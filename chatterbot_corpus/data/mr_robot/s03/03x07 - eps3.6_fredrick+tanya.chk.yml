- - Stay right there!
  - Don't you fucking move!
- - Why'd he surrender?
  - Who is your leader?
- - Fsociety.
  - A honeypot? For what?
- - A specific server, involved in the last fsociety attack.
  - CS.
- - You should know that nothing's gonna come from this.
  - It's nice to finally meet you.
- - Are you sure he is good to go?
  - When we spoke earlier, he was looking at me like we'd never met.
- - Make sure this doesn't happen again.
  - fucking weirdo.
- - I texted you the address.
  - Is that where Tyrell is?
- - Yes.
  - We gotta act before Wellick disappears
- - for another five months.
  - You said you'd bring my family to me.
- - It's gonna work out the way we discussed.
  - Angela, whatever Whiterose told you is a lie.
- - These consequences were necessary...
  - People are going to die!
- - No, they're going to be fine!
  - Listen to me. You have to stop the attack.
- - There's one last thing I need in order to execute
  - the full force of the Dark Army.
- - A reported buildings
  - owned by E Corp exploded or caught fire.
- - When you see Whiterose, make sure you say I did you good.
  - We're gonna stay with my buddy in Arizona.
- - If what I discovered is real, do you know what that means?
  - We can potentially undo this whole thing.
- - Excuse me, do you have the time?
  - Reports are still coming in from across the country...
- - But based on the number of targets,
  - we are now in the midst of
- - the worst attack on U.S. soil
  - in the history of our nation.
- - In a series of seemingly orchestrated strikes
  - across the country,
- - a reported buildings owned by E Corp
  - exploded or caught fire.
- - There has been no official confirmation,
  - or even speculation, as to what caused
- - the explosions and fires to occur.
  - Officials with knowledge of the attacks
- - have stated that the death toll...
  - I know it may seem petty in light of today, but...
- - I just can't stop thinking about it.
  - Keep turning it over in my mind.
- - Frasier.
  - Now, my homie said it's iconic and shit.
- - Even won a record Primetime Emmys, or whatever.
  - So I started watching.
- - And I'm cool with suspending my disbelief a little,but this?
  - Am I really supposed to believe a baldin' white dude from Seattle gets to smash that much?
- - And it's not like he was slaying hood rats, neither.
  - This nigga get more butt than ash trays.
- - Turned me off from the fucking situation comedies altogether.
  - Had to cleanse the palate.
- - And I know it only got one Emmy nomination, but I'll tell you, you wanna see a believable protagonist doing extraordinary shit?
  - Don't sleep on Knight Rider, yo.
- - As of now, no one has claimed responsibility
  - for this nightmarish attack.
- - You don't have to kill us.
  - You know, we can... we... We can work with you.
- - Haven't... haven't enough people died already today?
  - My man. My man...
- - Relax.
  - Calm down.
- - If I was here to take you out, would've done it already.
  - Your roomie here serves as a prime example to that.
- - Then what is it? Why are you here?
  - Oh, just to babysit, to keep you guys safe and sound.
- - Will be tested in the coming days
  - as we learn more, as we find those responsible..
- - You know, it's kinda sad, actually, the general lack of respect afforded to Knight Rider.
  - They throw fucking gold statues at the Crane brothers, but Michael Knight and KITT, their relationship predicted the current societal dependence on technology, and that was years ago.
- - Plus, anytime Mike spits game on a chick, I swear, I believe every goddamn word.
  - If nothing else, Knight Rider should've won a fucking statue for his dope ass theme song.
- - I mean, the shit just stays with you.
  - Stuck in my head right now, in fact.
- - A National Terrorism Advisory System
  - has issued an imminent alert bulletin,
- - after a reported E Corp buildings
  - were targeted in a coordinated attack
- - unlike any the world has seen.
  - At this time, many looming questions remain
- - the cause of the explosions
  - that brought so much destruction,
- - or worse, if any additional attacks are to follow.
  - Unfortunately, what we do know
- - is that...
  - Elliot, it's okay.
- - Just calm down and keep breathing.
  - Okay.
- - And you can tell me what it is that you think you did, okay?
  - Just breathe, and whenever you're ready, we can talk.
- - Okay.
  - Um...
- - Uh...
  - I, um...
- - I think we...
  - I'm... I'm sorry.
- - I don't know if I can say it.
  - I don't know if I can say it, what... I'm sorry, Krista.
- - What... what he...
  - Or I...
- - What... what...
  - What we both may have done, I don't know if I can say it.
- - I'm sorry.
  - I'm sorry, I don't know if I can say it.
- - I don't know if I can say it.
  - I'm sorry.
- - I don't know if I can say it.
  - Nice to see you again, beautiful.
- - Hello, Mr. Robot.
  - Of course he comes running to you after today.
- - So predictable.
  - Elliot said he wanted to speak to me, but... conscious or not, I suspect that he thought it was more important that I speak to you.
- - Why do you have to keep going through a middleman?
  - Why can't he just speak to me himself?
- - I'm not sure he wants to, but I wanna help you figure out why.
  - Elliot told me he's worried that you may have done something harmful.
- - Do you know what he might be referencing?
  - Everything that happened today is because he was ignoring our responsibilities.
- - What happened exactly?
  - The point is...
- - It's not me he has to worry about.
  - It's the others, the real string pullers.
- - Who would that be?
  - You wanna know what's really going on?
- - Look around, sweetheart.
  - I'm not the only one under their thumb.
- - They're manipulating everything, always, just to line their own pockets, to have total control.
  - But that's the conspiracy, man.
- - So you and Elliot...
  - You want to challenge these manipulators?
- - Me and Elliot wanted to take the control away, give it back to the ones who were getting shit on.
  - We got halfway there, until someone swiped my ideas and warped them to suit whatever bullshit agenda served their self-interest.
- - That's what Five/Nine was about, our revolution.
  - So you are a supporter of Five/Nine?
- - Supporter?
  - I was no supporter.
- - I was the architect!
  - How about telling me why you think Elliot might be upset with you?
- - I don't have time for this shit.
  - I gotta find the pricks who screwed me.
- - Turn on the news, lady.
  - All these buildings fucking blowing up.
- - I think they're trying to pin that shit on me.
  - I know it. It ain't happening.
- - So, the attacks today were a part of the revolution you created?
  - Is that what you're saying?
- - We were only supposed to take out one location, once all the paper records were centralized.
  - That was it.
- - Yeah, I've gotta be honest with you, Mr. Robot, this sounds like delusions of grandeur.
  - How else do you explain what the authorities are saying?
- - They claim to have the man responsible.
  - Wellick?
- - No, he was working for me, but you and the rest of the world are never gonna know that, because you keep happily lapping up those sugar-coated pearls of semen they keep pouring down your throats.
  - You're buying the narrative that they've been pushing for months.
- - Pigs at a trough!
  - You still don't believe me.
- - You're indulging me right now, like I'm one of your nutso patients.
  - Do the math.
- - Elliot worked at Allsafe, ground zero for Five/Nine.
  - He was also arrested for hacking.
- - He even hacked you, didn't he?
  - And he's completely out of his mind.
- - You add all that up...
  - You still want to doubt me?
- - Good people of Earth, there is more up our sleeves.
  - buildings is a parlor trick.
- - Our true act of sorcery will astound within the next hours.
  - To all fat cats, gluttons, and honchos, as you lazily don your ribbons of remembrance for this tragic day, do not forget, the clock is ticking.
- - I think the public may lose faith in the Bureau, once they learn that you squandered the chance to prevent another attack.
  - I'm not gonna be strong-armed, not by you, not after today.
- - Then I suggest you start taking my client's words seriously.
  - This is unreal.
- - The country's under attack, and you're protecting him?
  - Wellick was targeted, because of his access and credentials at E Corp.
- - These terrorists threatened his wife and son if he didn't comply.
  - For five straight months, my client was held captive in a basement.
- - You can't expect us to buy this.
  - We have confirmation.
- - Wellick gave an unauthorized order to put server CSback on the network, the same night the hack was initiated, all while being investigated for murder.
  - Yeah, a charge for which he's been cleared.
- - That doesn't change the facts.
  - Wellick got passed over for CTO, got fired, two days later, disappears, and now, hours before the largest terror attack ever on U.S. soil, Wellick resurfaces, claiming he was kidnapped.
- - So, what, are you charging my client with coincidental resurfacing?
  - We don't call that coincidence around here.
- - We call it bullshit.
  - Dom...
- - We have motive.
  - With no hard evidence.
- - But here's what you do have.
  - You have a guy that'll point you to the terrorists who held him hostage, the actual people behind the attacks, the same ones planning more destruction.
- - Mr. Wellick can ID them, and tell you their likely location, in exchange for protection and immunity.
  - We're not gonna cut a deal.
- - We're gonna charge him and just add obstruction of justice on top of it.
  - You saw the video.
- - Time is not a luxury that you have, not with another attack on the horizon, so... do you really wanna sit here and continue to quibble about Mr. Wellick?
  - Let's just round them all up, Darlene, Elliot, Angela Moss.
- - Let's just haul 'em all in here and go at 'em hard.
  - Wellick's lawyer is right.
- - Time is not our friend here.
  - And if Tyrell can get us two workable leads...
- - We're being played!
  - How do you not see this?
- - I still think the Dark Army's involved, and bringing in the others might expose that.
  - I have to brief Comey, and he has to brief the President.
- - I won't go to them with half-assed theories again, not when this much is on the line.
  - Why do you keep ignoring our credible sources?
- - The most credible one being in that room.
  - Tyrell Wellick's name alone is going to play better with them than the others.
- - Play better?
  - Are you already wondering how this is gonna look?
- - You wanna cover this up to the FBI Director and the President of the United States?
  - Spare me the conspiracy theories.
- - I need to bring them something concrete.
  - And if Wellick's lying?
- - Then this deal is off, and we have our guy.
  - It's a win-win for us, either way.
- - Why are you fighting with me on this?
  - Because something's not adding up.
- - What's that supposed to mean?
  - I don't know if this is because you're overworked or stressed out or just under some delusion that you're a fucking super-cop, but it stops now.
- - You report to me.
  - Start remembering that.
- - As to what caused the explosions and fires to...
  - Tyrell Wellick and took him into custody...
- - Warned of another attack
  - within the next hours.
- - Of our company's paper rec...
  - Officials with knowledge of the attacks
- - have stated that the death toll
  - is expected to be well...
- - Right now, the estimate's around ,.
  - What estimate?
- - The dead.
  - But it's still climbing.
- - Okay, maybe you should just chill with the TV for a second.
  - They're gonna be okay, right?
- - Who's that?
  - All those people who died.
- - Do you think that they're gonna be okay?
  - I'm gonna go grab my shit and come back.
- - It won't be long.
  - Just don't go anywhere, okay?
- - Can we just take a break? I, um... I need a minute.
  - Unfortunately, that's not possible.
- - As you know, this is time-sensitive.
  - Okay.
- - But after this, I get to see my family, yes?
  - It's very important that I see my wife and child.
- - I'll be sure to relay your request to my superior.
  - For now, though, need your eyes on that book.
- - You shouldn't have told anyone, Mom.
  - I could get in trouble for telling you.
- - Well, you can't be afraid to leave the house.
  - You still have two treatments left.
- - Don't listen to that video.
  - It's just a scare tactic.
- - We caught the guy.
  - Fine, fi... fine.
- - I'll call Dr. Zeigler, and ask if it can wait.
  - I love you too.
- - The operation took place at Red Wheelbarrow Barbecue,
  - it's a popular fast food restaurant
- - in Manhattan's Flatiron District.
  - Wellick ID'd the two suspects, both corroborated by Sasan Nouri, our fsociety video perp.
- - You call it in?
  - We're about to release a BOLO.
- - Nice work, Stanchek.
  - I'll see you down in the squad room.
- - Okay.
  - And, uh, sir?
- - What?
  - It's Wellick.
- - He keeps asking about his family.
  - He wants to see 'em.
- - It's just us now.
  - We can speak freely.
- - You need to get anything off your chest?
  - Well... there's some information that's about to be declassified for public release, and before you hear it from your lawyer or somebody else, I wanted to personally come here and deliver it to you.
- - Rumor has it you're asking about your family?
  - Yes, I've been told that if I cooperate...
- - Your wife's dead.
  - Almost two weeks now.
- - What?
  - No, you must be mistaken.
- - Lovers' quarrel with a dude she was banging.
  - He shot her in the head at close range.
- - It's nasty stuff.
  - Lies. You're lying.
- - Which means that your son is currently being raised at Peaceful Acres Foster Care.
  - Now, last I checked, it was only a one in five abuse rate.
- - Decent odds.
  - No.
- - No.
  - This can't be true.
- - I know you're lying.
  - I want to see my wife. I demand it.
- - If you're thinking about telling anyone here about me, if you veer from the plan at all, I promise, you won't live
  - to place a flower at your wife's grave.
- - And your son...
  - I'll make it my personal mission to ensure he becomes a statistic.
- - Just another forgotten child, lost to the system, forever.
  - They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
- - You always gotta watch M*therfuckers around you
  - Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
- - We all must meet our moment of truth
  - The same sheisty cats that you hang with
- - And do your thang with could set you up
  - And wet you up, nigga, peep the language
- - It's universal, you play with fire
  - It may hurt you or burn you
- - Lesson...
  - I know what this is. You sent that email to the FBI.
- - I knew the Dark Army would find out.
  - I'm not stupid. I never sent the email.
- - How do you explain this? Why are we here?
  - Kay, maybe he's not gonna kill us, but someone sure is.
- - If anything does happen to us, if I don't make it back to my computer, I sent the email to go out automatically to someone I trust.
  - I'm supposed to be on a J-Date with Juanita at Ruby Tuesdays, as we speak.
- - She's probably worried about me.
  - Hey. Hey, maybe... Maybe she'll call the cops,
- - report me missing.
  - Doubt it.
- - Besides, what are you even doing on J-Date?
  - You're not even Jewish.
- - And doesn't sound like she is, either.
  - I told you, myandMe said I'm % Ashkenazi, and for your information, her full name is Juanita Rosenberg.
- - Look, do you think I wanna be stuck in the backseat of a psychopath's Cadillac with you?
  - I should be at home with my family.
- - My brother is probably flipping out right now.
  - You think your brother's flipping out?
- - That guy...slit my friend's throat, and now he's digging what could be a mass grave over there.
  - Yeah. If your brother's flipping out, I'm like a Sam Kinison stand-up bit, okay, Shelley Duvall at the Overlook Hotel.
- - I'm at hot mic'd Christian Bale levels of intensity and hysteria, so please, don't talk to me about flipping out.
  - Yes. Yes.
- - What... hang on, what are you doing?
  - You gotta get us out of here.
- - I can't...
  - I don't know how to drive.
- - You have a genius level IQ, and you can't work an automatic transmission?
  - I grew up in the city. I never had to learn.
- - Oh, yeah, well, you do now, kay?
  - Get up there, put pedal to the metal.
- - Yeah, okay, okay. Okay.
  - Floor it. Floor it.
- - Okay.
  - Floor it!
- - Floor it!
  - Go, go, go, go, go!
- - Yo, I got one lyric pointed
  - At your head to start
- - Another one is pointed at your weak-ass heart
  - Now, if I pull the trigger on these fully-loaded lines
- - You're gonna wish I woulda pulled a black
  - I mack dimes, crack the spines of the fake gangsters
- - Easy! Easy!
  - Damn.
- - That's no way to treat a Caddie.
  - I can't just do nothing.
- - I almost went straight to the authorities.
  - Oh, well, let's thank our lucky stars you opted to call me first.
- - I told you what he said.
  - How can I not report this?
- - As your counsel and your friend, I should remind you, you are bound by doctor-patient privilege, so unless he's stated intent to do something in the future, you can't turn him in.
  - Per HIPPA, you'll lose your license and practice.
- - No, there's something about this. I can feel it.
  - I know him.
- - I actually think he might've been involved.
  - You know how many crazies are out there claiming responsibility for the attacks?
- - The... the FBI and the police are inundated by phone calls from people just like your client.
  - fuck.
- - Any updates?
  - They think the total will be over ,.
- - But the number doesn't really matter now...
  - Even if there's more.
- - What do you mean even if there's more?
  - No matter what happens now, everything will be fine.
- - Angela, if there are more attacks, you have to tell me.
  - I don't know anything about them.
- - What are you doing?
  - Here, let me show you.
- - Okay. Watch.
  - See?
- - They all came back.
  - They're all fine.
- - Here, I'll show you again.
  - Told you.
- - Everyone's okay again.
  - Everyone's gonna be okay.
- - Everyone's gonna be okay.
  - Our FBI reporters say that there was evidence found
- - at Red Wheelbarrow that...
  - Tyrell Wellick had been hiding out
- - in the restaurant's basement.
  - The FBI's investigating the possibility
- - that the same fsociety members behind Five/Nine...
  - were operating out of the barbecue eatery.
- - Interestingly enough, the basement itself
  - does not appear on any plans or blueprints
- - reported with the city, so it is possible
  - that Tyrell Wellick and fsociety were operating
- - unbeknownst to the Red Wheelbarrow Barbecue.
  - While unsuspecting employees are not a risk to unwitting
- - customers, justified the notorious hacker claim.
  - I can make you dance I can make you sing
- - I can make you dance I can make you sing
  - You want me to
- - Hey.
  - Hey!
- - Stagewas my operation.
  - You assholes went rogue...
- - Oh I can make you dance I can make you sing
  - I can make you dance I can make you sing
- - You want me to
  - As everyone in this room knows well nothing creates profit quite like global conflict.
- - Bullshit.
  - Ah, Phillip.
- - Always a pleasure, though I am surprised to see you with all you have on your plate.
  - You know damn well I'm marooned here.
- - Well, then a little bit of good news on an otherwise trying day.
  - My government did finally get around to signing that accord.
- - Ecoin is poised to become the world standard.
  - After your latest outburst, nothing could save my company.
- - My actions were never meant to harm E Corp.
  - On the contrary, good old-fashioned American sympathy will go a long way in boosting an already surging Ecoin.
- - E Corp is the very definition of too big to fail.
  - Trust me, it will survive.
- - But I won't.
  - So... is that... is that what all this has been then?
- - No.
  - When... when you surprised me with Five/Nine, I understood your move.
- - A false flag operation, a temporary global crisis to help me pressure the administration into giving you your damn Congo.
  - All went according to plan, which leaves me struggling to find the upside to this.
- - Why come after me?
  - Think back on that fateful night.
- - We sat, listening to a young woman playing a lyre.
  - A lawsuit was brewing against my plant.
- - You told me you would...
  - Handle that person as we usually do.
- - And yet, your pet project, Angela Moss, was allowed to continue with her lawsuit...
  - Which put my plans in jeopardy.
- - Your job was simple manipulate her, control her.
  - You couldn't, so I had to.
- - You little piece of shit.
  - Do not forget, I installed you as CEO only to protect my plant.
- - You were meant to do what your predecessor couldn't, and look at what happened to him.
  - And now, you will follow every order that I give you, including hiring your own replacement.
- - fuck you.
  - In the interim, uh, I trust that there will be no interference, with my plant being relocated to the Congo.
- - This... this is funny.
  - That's... that's... That's all this is.
- - This is... this is, uh... This is a joke with a bad punchline.
  - You will also be called upon to handle all logistical issues proper access for my staff, shipment of all materials...
- - No! You give me the real reason, m*therfucker.
  - Coming at me now.
- - What in God's name do you hope to gain?
  - The opportunity to teach a lesson.
- - A lesson? You sadistic fuck.
  - You got your U.N. vote, you got your plant, you got everything you wanted!
- - No. You don't get off that easy, not until you explain it to me.
  - You had to destroy so much.
- - Why?
  - Because, Phillip...
- - I had to ask you twice.
  - What if we're being recruited?
- - Recruited into digging our own grave?
  - Look at the dimensions.
- - This hole's only big enough for your friend.
  - What if we're being recruited into the Dark Army?
- - They could've... They could've just asked.
  - They're probably planning a follow-up attack, and they need to use us for our skills.
- - You know I can hear you, right?
  - Even from way back here.
- - Every word.
  - Come on, man.
- - At least tell us what the Dark Army wants from us.
  - Tell us what's going on, or we stop digging!
- - We're serious.
  - I kinda like you two.
- - You guys are funny, in a George-Elaine kinda way.
  - Still wouldn't try me, though.
- - I got a job to do, and... you don't wanna know where this knife been.
  - You feel me?
- - Get out of the car.
  - Hurry up. I'm running out of time here.
- - See that up there?
  - What is this?
- - You know why those people are enjoying themselves so much, even though thousands died today in the biggest attack in U.S. history?
  - That wasn't my fault. That wasn't supposed to happen.
- - I wanna know who made that call.
  - Was it Tyrell? What about this other attack?
- - That was never a part of my plan.
  - See, kid, that's been your mistake the entire time, thinking this whole thing's about your silly little plan.
- - No, your revolution was only allowed to happen
  - cause it was bought and paid for by people like them.
- - Face it, no matter how hard you try...
  - That's always the end result.
- - What the hell?
  - You're going in?
- - Uh, mistress of a senator we got on the payroll.
  - Powdered her nose with some bad shit, died a couple hours ago.
- - I'm just here to make it scandal-free.
  - You see what I mean?
- - Literally nothing can stop these shindigs, not thousands dead across the country, not a lifeless mistress in the guest bathroom.
  - Hm.
- - I guess they got here sooner than I thought.
  - Worm-catching M*therfuckers, you know?
- - What's going on?
  - Who are these people?
- - This is where we say our good-byes.
  - What?
- - You're leaving us with them?
  - As you know, I'm... I'm only a chaperone here.
- - Well, what happens now to us?
  - Well, that will be up to him.
- - And I got my fingers crossed he treats you guys all right.
  - Mr. Markesh...
- - Ms. Biswas...please follow me into the garage.
  - What is this?
- - Take a seat.
  - Please.
- - Now... tell me what you see.
  - Location confirmed. We're in position.
- - Repeat location confirmed.
  - We're in position.
- - Be safe out there, boys.
  - Keep your head on a swivel.
- - Alpha team approaching the door. Taking position.
  - Stand by for breach.
- - Assault force is on the white side, ready for primary breach.
  - A threat analysis for the FAA's next-gen IP based system.
- - Targeting IPs in Chicago, Atlanta, L.A.
  - Bravo team set. Holding perimeter.
- - This is malware that targets air-traffic control systems at major airports.
  - They're planning another attack, probably like today, except... this time, they're crashing planes.
- - Copy, Bravo. Got Alpha and Bravo teams in position.
  - But the exploit's already written.
- - What do you need us for?
  - Execute, execute, execute!
- - Go. Let's go.
  - Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
- - Alpha team is in. Repeat Alpha team is in.
  - In the Dark Army, we understand what it's like to believe in something.
- - We're willing to die for our cause, without thinking twice, because we know we are all soldiers of something much larger.
  - Please don't kill us.
- - Please don't do this.
  - Room's clear.
- - Bravo team, stand by.
  - Something else we all believe in self-sacrifice, because when you serve a higher power, no act is more honorable than suicide.
- - There is no greater gift one can offer the cause...
  - Than everything.
- - Secure garage, Alpha One.
  - We can do whatever you want.
- - Please. Maybe you can use us.
  - Everything in this room, from the plans to crash the airplanes to your very presence, is only here to tell a story.
- - Sadly, we have no use for your skills, but you both do serve a very important purpose.
  - No. Oh, no, no, no...
- - No...
  - No, no, no, don't give me the gun! No, please don't!
- - No! Stop!
  - No, please don't!
- - No! Stop! No!
  - Please don't!
- - No!
  - You don't have to do this. You don't have to...
