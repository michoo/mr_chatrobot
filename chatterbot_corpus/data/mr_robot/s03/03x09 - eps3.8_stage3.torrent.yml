  - All those people who died, they think the total will be over ,.
- - What are you doing?
  - See? They all came back.
- - I thought I would never win.
  - Not until I met Whiterose.
- - Don't think for a second that I don't know
  - that you're keeping something from me.
- - No, no, no. Listen to me.
  - You have to stop the attack!
- - Your wife's dead, which means that your son is currently being raised at Peaceful Acres Foster Care.
  - If you're thinking about telling anyone here about me,
- - you won't live to place a flower at your wife's grave.
  - But we still haven't discussed the coltan mines.
- - The fucking Congo can wait.
  - It's time Phillip Price's hand got slapped.
- - If the UN approves our annexation of the Congo,
  - we can finally move our operation.
- - My actions were never meant to harm E Corp.
  - Trust me, it will survive.
- - But I won't.
  - Mr. Alderson can die for us, just like his father.
- - Something ain't right about this guy.
  - I don't trust him.
- - If what I discovered is real, do you know what that means?
  - We could potentially undo this whole thing.
- - If anything does happen to us,
  - I sent the email to go out automatically
- - to someone I trust.
  - Maybe there still are things left for me to do.
- - Evil Corp is% of our business.
  - If we lose them, it's gonna be it for us.
- - It's gonna be it for me.
  - Allsafe officially opened its doors in ' .
- - We have a relatively small roster, but that way our clients have unprecedented access, our undivided attention...
  - All those are standards E Corp expects
- - from any vendor we hire.
  - Terry, please.
- - Let him continue.
  - Allsafe has several other clients also in the Fortune .
- - And when called upon, we help them out in some pretty sticky incident response scenarios.
  - We'll be making a bit of a splash next month when we release ourreport.
- - That's all teddy bears and hand jobs, but what are your financials?
  - We can't wake up one day and find ourselves tits up, dicks blowing in the breeze.
- - Um, well, yes. Of course, of course, Thank you, Angela.
  - Hey, hon, you want to top me off?
- - And add a pinch of Sweet'N Low, but not too much.
  - Angela, uh, my assistant can handle that.
- - It's okay.
  - No, no. It's okay.
- - Regarding our financials, Mr. Colby, this will correspond to page eight.
  - Well, that was a cute field trip, Phillip.
- - Next time I waste an afternoon, though, I'd prefer a happy ending.
  - Now what's the real angle here?
- - We headed to Legz &amp; Lace for happy hour?
  - We're gonna hire them.
- - Set the deal in motion immediately.
  - What... I... I don't understand.
- - Is there something bigger behind the scenes here we should know about, or...
  - I want the contract executed as soon as possible.
- - Mr. Price, if I may...
  - I'm hesitant to depend on Allsafe as our security operation center.
- - I'm confident I could lead a team to establish our own internal SOC.
  - And with the appropriate resources...
- - I'm sorry, Mister, uh...
  - Wellick.
- - Wellick! Mr. Wellick!
  - I'm sorry if I misled you into thinking that I was seeking your counsel or approval, because I most certainly am not.
- - Understood.
  - Good.
- - Just hope it doesn't come back to haunt us.
  - This decision has been made.
- - Remember to alert the Bureau if you're going to leave the city, Mr. Wellick.
  - And no international travel for now.
- - Mr. Robot.
  - He took over again.
- - They own the FBI.
  - What is he trying to say?
- - Who's they?
  - Dark Army. It's gotta be.
- - fuck, I left my machine unlocked.
  - Trenton's email.
- - Did he see this?
  - If he did, he knows that Trenton was close
- - to finding a way to undo Five/Nine
  - and that I'm gonna finish what she started.
- - He also looked up info on Tyrell Wellick's release.
  - Why?
- - What exactly did Mr. Robot do last night?
  - Seventy-one buildings.
- - Was it worth it?
  - Get the fuck out of my home.
- - Gotta say, your revised plan was batshit insane.
  - It was supposed to be only one building, but what you did...
- - I did what had to be done.
  - You mean, what they told you to do.
- - What'd they promise you, huh? Money?
  - This isn't about them.
- - This is about when you fucked me!
  - I lost everything because of you.
- - My son's taken to Denmark, and my wife's dead!
  - Okay.
- - Okay, I can't say that it's all been smooth sailing, but you gotta see the big picture.
  - There is no big picture!
- - There was a job, and I fulfilled my duty, and that's more than I can say for you.
  - Oh, come on! You know damn well that's not how the Dark Army works.
- - You don't go from most wanted man on the planet to hero unless they have plans for you, how can you not see that?
  - The things I did, the things I sacrificed,
- - I earned my freedom.
  - That's the least they could give me.
- - Horseshit. You're being added to a collection of puppets.
  - No puppet, no puppet. You're the puppet!
- - Wake up! You made a deal with a force that's bigger than you!
  - When the time comes, they're gonna ask you to pay what they feel you owe them!
- - This is a childish conspiracy!
  - Childish? Who's the one who said we were gods, huh?
- - Time to grow up. There are no gods.
  - Our closest deities are a society of the richest, most influential men in existence.
- - I'm done with this.
  - Men who fuck over the rest of us for profit, for fun, and then leave us in the streets for dead.
- - Just like your Joanna!
  - You don't talk about my wife.
- - Wouldn't she want you to realize the truth and fight?
  - Or would she want you to be their little bitch?
- - There you go. Fight!
  - That's the Tyrell who's been missing.
- - Now you want to stop them, too, before they put you in that choke collar?
  - Unless you're into that sort of thing.
- - What?
  - Oh, hello, sir.
- - May I come in?
  - Oh, shit.
- - Didn't mean to interrupt.
  - Good evening, Mr. Alderson.
- - Please join us.
  - After all, you were a part of this too.
- - It's weird, being here again.
  - Like we've come to that slow glide
- - at the end of a roller coaster.
  - We're coming full circle.
- - Darlene and Mr. Robot started this whole thing,
  - and now she and I are gonna end it.
- - Trenton was investigating Romero ever since she found out he was monitoring our machines.
  - This is big.
- - Why'd she send this to you?
  - I don't know.
- - If Trenton's right, and encryption keys were exported the night of the hack, then there's a chance we can recover all of E Corp's data.
  - If we can find those keys.
- - Why would Romero do this?
  - There was never supposed to be a Plan B, that was the whole point.
- - This hack was supposed to be all in.
  - He did it for the reason we need those keys now, in case our revolution failed.
- - We need access to his keylogger files.
  - The feds confiscated his drives.
- - Now all of his data is in the FBI evidence storage system.
  - Sentinel, yeah, I know it well.
- - That's why I'm here.
  - I need you to give me all the intel you have about the FBI.
- - You do realize this isn't Angela batting her lashes at some feds to drop a femtocell at their E Corp office?
  - Sentinel is the Fort Knox of closed networks.
- - And you want us to just waltz in there and...
  - Not us.
- - Me. I'm gonna do it.
  - Did you not hear me?
- - You will get busted.
  - I don't care how good you think you are.
- - The only way we do this is if I go to them.
  - I'll hit up my contact...
- - We can't trust them.
  - The Dark Army owns the FBI.
- - How do you know that?
  - Doesn't matter.
- - Going to them isn't an option.
  - I might have an angle.
- - No, I told you...
  - I spent the last two months working with the feds.
- - I know how they operate.
  - I'm miles ahead of you on this.
- - Okay? I can do this.
  - What's your angle?
- - My angle is you trust me.
  - You gotta promise me.
- - Any sign of trouble, you bail.
  - Even if we do this, do you really think it'll make a difference?
- - I mean the whole world has gone to shit.
  - And we did that. All we can do now is rebuild.
- - At least that's a start.
  - And the Dark Army?
- - You think they're just gonna be painting each other's toenails while we go and undo everything they've worked for?
  - You just worry about getting into Sentinel.
- - Let me worry about the Dark Army.
  - Believe me now?
- - Lovely lady like you with a Taurus?
  - I don't think so. It's not a good fit.
- - But this baby, huh?
  - It's nice.
- - Bang a left up here.
  - I hear you're looking to barter a TAG Heuer?
- - My ex-husband's.
  - I'm sure we can arrange a deal.
- - And I really want to feel you pump the gas here.
  - Let her open up.
- - Yeah?
  - Doesn't that feel good?
- - Oh.
  - Is this supposed to... I think it's dead.
- - You know what? Coast her to the shoulder here on the left.
  - I'll check things out.
- - Onboard computer's so smart, it probably senses something.
  - What are you doing?
- - You know what to do.
  - Tell you what, why don't you stroll on back to the lot, peruse those Sonatas.
- - I'll meet you there in a second.
  - Go ahead.
- - I'm right behind you.
  - I called OnStar and the cops are on their way, so we don't have much time. I need you to set a meet.
- - Look kid, I already told you, we're done...
  - Stage Three.
- - What the fuck is Stage Three?
  - Just do what you do and set the meet with Whiterose.
- - Since when do I take orders from you?
  - If you don't move on this, it'll be on you to tell your employer why you fucked with their timeline.
- - Hey.
  - You're late.
- - I'm surprised you agreed to meet.
  - Thought you weren't allowed one-on-ones.
- - Technically, you're not a source anymore, so I'll classify this as a social meet.
  - But I suggest you get to the point of why you called.
- - First, how about a peace offering?
  - Shots?
- - You said you had something to tell me.
  - So talk or this is over.
- - I've been thinking about our last conversation.
  - Especially after...
- - Everything with Trenton and Mobley, and you were right.
  - There are things I haven't told you.
- - I'm listening.
  - Okay, well, how does this work?
- - Is this off the record, or am I fucking my own immunity?
  - Depends.
- - Everything you said, you were on point.
  - Whiterose was behind everything.
- - Five/Nine, the Dark Army were our partners.
  - They handled the Chinese side, we took care of it over here.
- - And Whiterose, did you talk to him?
  - There was a middle man.
- - If the Dark Army was involved, then Whiterose had to greenlight it.
  - Would you be willing to go on the record about what you know?
- - If I testified...
  - You know what the Dark Army's capable of.
- - Darlene, you gotta rethink this.
  - We can protect you, we'll make things right.
- - Tyrell's walking free, and your friends are dead.
  - Do it for them!
- - Fine. I gotta use the bathroom.
  - fuck...
- - This is a reminder that today's city-wide curfew
  - begins at p.m. this evening
- - through a.m. tomorrow morning.
  - Stay indoors and off the streets.
- - This is proof.
  - It's finally happening.
- - We're going back to the way that things should be.
  - Angela, I want to help you, but you got to explain to me what you think is happening.
- - I can't tell you that.
  - Only Whiterose can do that.
- - Whiterose manipulated you.
  - She exploited your feelings about your mom, and used them against you. That's what she does.
- - I thought that you wanted our parents back.
  - That's never going to happen.
- - That's because you don't understand.
  - We can't talk here.
- - There are people that are trying to stop this.
  - Let's go inside.
- - I know this may sound like bullshit, but I'm sorry I was such a pain in the ass.
  - The pressure of trying to find Tyrell and lying to my brother, and secluding myself in that apartment, just feeling lonely as shit,
- - I guess it was just too much.
  - So this is my long-winded way of saying I don't think
- - I have it in me to testify.
  - Maybe I'm not as cool and collected as I put on.
- - I get the front you put up.
  - It's a trick I use myself.
- - You are an FBI agent, yet somehow I feel like you're the only one I can trust.
  - Maybe that's because you can.
- - Yeah. Maybe so.
  - Okay, well, I hope the intel helped.
- - Sorry I couldn't do more.
  - You're leaving?
- - Thanks for the drink, and for listening.
  - Wait, you want another?
- - On me?
  - So you still single?
- - Wow!
  - Jumping right into this conversation again.
- - Haven't you learned my social game isn't my strong suit?
  - Well, I'm willing to bet you've got some untapped talent.
- - What's your type?
  - Where are you going with this?
- - Well, I am one hell of a wingwoman, okay?
  - So let's pick you out one of these lovelies here.
- - What about that ginger?
  - What, are you not into fire crotch? Hypocrite.
- - Dye job.
  - Fine.
- - Goth hipster in the corner?
  - Identity issues.
- - Oh, okay.
  - Ooh, what about that?
- - Oh, my God. Barkeep! Another round.
  - Sup, cuz?
- - Oh, shit. Sorry, dude.
  - Don't let me interrupt your flow or anything,
- - I mean I didn't know you had a female caller.
  - Who's he?
- - This is why you're asking about our plan, isn't it?
  - Angela.
- - You've been trying to listen to me, haven't you?
  - Did you hear me?
- - Did you hear what we were saying out there?
  - I've just been sitting here, smoking these trees, girl.
- - I don't know what the fuck you talking about.
  - You're trying to trap me.
- - Aren't you?
  - Angela.
- - You have to leave.
  - Get out now, trust me.
- - You've been trying to trick me.
  - That's why you wanted me to explain everything.
- - It's you who's trying to stop our plan.
  - I thought you were on my side.
- - Dude, your girl's trippin'.
  - Look, I don't know what you guys got going on, and I'm sorry, sweetheart, but we really ain't got the time right now.
- - We got business to attend to, and she-she gotta go, bro.
  - One way or another.
- - Don't worry, I'm leaving.
  - You're not going to get any more information out of me.
- - Slow your roll, cuz.
  - We gotta get.
- - We got a tight schedule to maintain.
  - I am here mainly as a formality, Wellick, to fake a smile and pretend to welcome you back.
- - You have been appointed CTO at E Corp.
  - I don't know what to say. Thank you.
- - You coming here personally...
  - Yes, yes. Right, right.
- - But the direct purpose of my visit...
  - I felt it was important to share with you formally that the CTO title is nothing more than that.
- - You are a mere figurehead I inherited from a deal gone wrong.
  - It happens from time to time.
- - But I wanted you to understand the nature of your position in case you should have loftier designs.
  - There'll be none of that.
- - Obedience will be your only task at my company.
  - I worry that could potentially get awkward if you thought differently, so I came here out of respect.
- - By your silence, I assume you accept this position?
  - I know what this is.
- - You're embarrassed that you fired me.
  - There's no shame in admitting the truth.
- - You're out of moves and your company needs me.
  - E Corp needs my image, the face of a hero.
- - That's why you're here.
  - Oh, Wellick, Wellick.
- - It's not that I'm out of moves.
  - It's that you're not worth one.
- - See you at the office, mm?
  - Five/Nine, fsociety.
- - You knew the entire time, didn't you?
  - Five/Nine, yes.
- - Well, not all the minutiae, of course.
  - But since the cyber bombings, the breadcrumbs haven't been that difficult to follow.
- - World catastrophes like this, they aren't caused by lone wolves like you.
  - They occur because men like me allow them.
- - You just happened to stumble into one of them.
  - No, no. I ran the operation. I pushed the button.
- - I am the one...
  - There you go again.
- - I, I, I...
  - You're still thinking like a lone wolf.
- - Why don't you tell me how I should be thinking?
  - Like a leader!
- - I am a leader!
  - Then where are your followers?
- - You can't force an agenda, Mr. Alderson.
  - You have to inspire one.
- - Nice digs.
  - Remember, I only let you in
- - because you said you're not into girls.
  - No, I said I wasn't a lesbian, end quote.
- - I didn't say I wasn't into girls.
  - Very clever.
- - How about that nightcap?
  - Right, but only one.
- - I gotta work in the morning, and you gotta get home before curfew.
  - Screw curfew.
- - Hey, that rhymes.
  - An E Kit?
- - God, I can't believe you bought into that shit.
  - You can never be too prepared.
- - Such a Girl Scout.
  - You think that's Girl Scout-y? Check this out.
- - Alexa, give me the daily Five/Nine.
  - Hello, and welcome to your daily Five/Nine report.
- - Officials advise to stay away from the Upper East Side,
  - where armed theft is at peak levels.
- - Impressive.
  - What else does that thing do?
- - Alexa, play John Prine.
  - Shuffling songs by John Prine.
- - That's better.
  - Why you didn't go after that blonde is beyond me.
- - She was mint.
  - Wasn't meant to be.
- - Whatevs. You didn't even try.
  - Jesus H., I think I'm drunk.
- - But it's...
  - Probably a good thing, 'cause I have like legit trouble sleeping.
- - I take melatonin, but I gotta down, like, six of them to even get drowsy, and then...
  - Send me an angel who flies from Montgomery
- - What was that?
  - It's cool.
- - No, it's...
  - No, it's not.
- - What am I doing? This isn't professional.
  - Dude, you said it yourself. I'm not a source anymore.
- - Believe it or not, I'm actually a real person.
  - Darlene, seriously.
- - All right.
  - Fine. I'm sorry, it's just...
- - I like you.
  - You're drunk.
- - Come on, at least give me more credit than that.
  - And no matter how I try, the years just flow by
- - Like a broken down dam
  - Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
- - Wait, hold on.
  - Um, one second.
- - Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
  - To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
- - There's flies in the kitchen
  - You could've kept the gun on.
- - Don't overthink this.
  - How the hell can a person
- - Go to work in the morning
  - We have to get moving.
- - We're not safe here.
  - I have to warn her. She has to know what they heard.
- - I could just get on the subway, she'll find us like before.
  - She'll protect us.
- - Since the cyber bombings,
  - there's been a wave of backlash
- - against the FBI from Americans of all backgrounds
  - and political views...
- - The one thing we heard over and over from those...
  - Was the sentiment that our law enforcement agencies
- - can no longer be trusted.
  - You ready?
- - Yo, Dr. Wang. How you doing?
  - And this is where we part ways.
- - Peace, brother.
  - Your bag.
- - Where we going?
  - Shut the fuck up. No questions.
- - I hear you have some information on Stage Three.
  - I need my laptop. It has my plans.
- - It's fine.
  - We can pull everything we need from there.
- - Why don't you have a seat?
  - Your password.
- - The first time you and I met to discuss the E Corp hack, you said this was a two-step plan.
  - So I'm sure you can imagine my surprise when out of the blue,
- - I now hear there is a third.
  - So, Mr. Alderson, why don't you tell me what it is you want?
- - I asked for a meet with Whiterose.
  - I'll relay any messages to her.
- - I need to speak with her directly.
  - You've had all the time you'll ever get with Whiterose.
- - I thought she wanted to kill E Corp.
  - Yes, I believe that's what we did.
- - No, E Coin didn't exist when we first created this plan.
  - Now it's the only thing keeping them afloat.
- - It's becoming the world standard.
  - And E Corp's entire existence relies upon it.
- - So what do you propose we do?
  - If you truly want to end them, eliminating E Coin is the only way.
- - Mr. Alderson, is this everything that you came to discuss with me?
  - Anything else on your mind?
- - Are you in or out?
  - Good-bye, Mr. Alderson.
- - I got CDs, everybody, come on!
  - They get your turnt!
- - Scan me E Coin, it's yours!
  - I got CDs! CDs! Yo, this shit'll get you turnt!
- - All right, scan me E Coin, and it's yours!
  - Hey, these savage tracks'll give you life, yo.
- - No.
  - I will not take your CD this time.
- - Miss Moss?
  - Mrs. Moss, I'm gonna need you to come with us.
- - CDs! CDs!
  - This shit'll get you turnt!
- - Scan me E Coin, and it's yours!
  - We're ready.
- - So this is why you came here.
  - You're not talking your way out of this.
- - Well, you were right.
  - Everything we did was what they wanted.
- - Exactly.
  - Whiterose, Price, and who the fuck knows who else?
- - I'm a prisoner, just like before.
  - Where does that leave me?
- - What am I supposed to do?
  - The CTO position is worthless. You heard him.
- - We can use it.
  - You see how they operate? In the shadows.
- - You just settle in, smile, nod.
  - When the time is right... we'll expose them.
- - Do you get it now?
  - E Corp, they might as well be a front for them!
- - Whiterose, Price, their friends, they're the ones we need to take down.
  - We just need a launching pad.
- - A place to begin, dig in.
  - Find that vulnerability.
- - The FBI.
  - The Dark Army has a man on the inside.
- - I don't understand.
  - How do you not understand?
- - You were trying to hack me.
  - An FBI agent.
- - And I already told you why.
  - Your bullshit's not gonna fly!
- - Enough!
  - You gonna fill me in?
- - Tell him.
  - Get fucked.
- - Every time you guys get intel, one of my friends ends up dead.
  - And Tyrell's bullshit release was as pathetic as a dry hand job.
- - Why should I trust you or anyone else here?
  - The FBI is obviously in bed with the Dark Army.
- - Where'd you hear that?
  - Chew balls.
- - Just tell me.
  - Why is she here?
- - She was in my home, attempting to steal my badge to get on Sentinel.
  - Full disclosure, sir, we had relations tonight.
- - I plan on self-reporting it to the OPR, I'm not keeping anything from the Bureau.
  - Do you have any idea how fucking big the crime you committed is?
- - You can forget about immunity this time.
  - And why the hell were you trying to get into Sentinel anyway?
- - You're in too deep this time, Darlene.
  - You gotta talk.
- - There are files in Sentinel that can help decrypt all of E Corp's data.
  - That means bringing everything back.
- - The solution to undoing Five/Nine is in a machine on the other side of this floor, okay?
  - They're in Romero's collection.
- - Sit with me, look over my shoulder,
  - I'll even walk through it with your engineer, whatever.
- - You guys can personally take the keys to E Corp and be the heroes, okay?
  - You can fix everything.
- - Isn't that what you want?
  - What you've been waiting for?
- - She's right! Wasn't this the point of our entire strategy?
  - You need to understand something...
- - This is the opportunity we've been chasing!
  - You're missing the point.
- - We have nothing to lose.
  - If she's lying, we put her in jail, but if she's not...
- - And what if our testimony gets thrown out because of your grossly unprofessional behavior?
  - Sleeping with a CHS, for Chrissake.
- - She's not a CHS anymore.
  - And you know I didn't break any rules.
- - So what's really happening here?
  - Why not take her up on her offer?
- - Get back to your desk and write the explaining your actions minute by minute.
  - I'm assigning Agent Kaz to Darlene.
- - That will continue to be part of the debate...
  - What's the plan here? She talks like she knows everything.
- - You sound stressed.
  - Of course I'm fucking stressed. I could be burnt.
- - Meanwhile, she claims she can undo the hack.
  - And where is she now?
- - Locked in a goddamn interview room.
  - Okay.
- - Is that all you've got? Okay?
  - Jesus, will you just tell me how do you want to proceed?
- - Not one box even packed?
  - I suppose there's some banal excuse why a month isn't enough time for those lazy mules to get my project shipped to the Congo?
- - Border security.
  - Border security across the Eastern seaboard is restricted to levels we've never seen before.
- - Hence our extensive payroll.
  - We own mayors, district attorneys, governors, fucking presidents!
- - The country is operating under martial law.
  - Our contacts are afraid.
- - You've always asked that I be honest with you.
  - Speak.
- - This is your fault.
  - You blindly indulge all of Elliot Alderson's whims.
- - And it has landed us here.
  - If you'd listened to me, if you believed in my strategy as much as you did his, we could have avoided this.
- - We had the UN vote, these attacks weren't necessary.
  - People like Phillip Price do not respect mercy.
- - You only get their attention with force and a lot of it.
  - That is the only currency with these men.
- - I will go back to our partners with a more persuasive argument.
  - See? That's all I needed to hear.
- - And...
  - What now?
- - I keep looking at this note,
  - wondering what Mr. Robot did last night.
- - If the Dark Army does own the FBI,
  - how did he find out?
- - Does it matter? I don't need him.
  - Darlene will be checking in soon about Sentinel,
- - and I have to enact Stage Three.
  - Mr. Alderson is claiming there is a third stage.
- - He wants to target E-Coin.
  - But I'm sure you knew all along there is no Stage Three.
- - A third stage. Odd.
  - That wasn't part of our original plan, was it?
- - No.
  - So what do you make of that?
- - His sister is currently being held at the FBI.
  - Claiming she can decrypt E Corp's data.
- - I can't help but notice their actions are incongruous.
  - He's lying to us.
- - I don't think their target is E Corp anymore.
  - I think it's us.
- - When the Dark Army operatives' malware
  - copies my file to their command and control server...
- - Get yourself back to work.
  - It'll be queued up for an operator
- - to review its contents.
  - Once opened, my exploit will give me full access
- - to their management interface.
  - Why the dismay?
- - We expected something like this out of him, did we not?
  - You never understood my commitment to Mr. Alderson.
- - You say that I was wrong to order the attack.
  - Maybe I'm wrong about him as well.
- - So tell me, what would you do if you had your way?
  - And now I own the Dark Army.
- - Do you remember when you said Elliot will one day follow in the footsteps of his father?
  - I think it's time he died for us too.
