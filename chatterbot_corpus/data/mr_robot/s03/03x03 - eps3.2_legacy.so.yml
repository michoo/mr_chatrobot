- - Tyrell Wellick. It's gonna be fun working with you.
  - I think you're beautiful. I want to take you home.
- - Detectives came by.
  - They want to speak with you.
- - They found a body on the roof.
  - And you both did know the deceased, Sharon Knowles.
- - Our network was compromised yesterday.
  - That server needs to remain a honeypot.
- - We have specific orders by Tyrell Wellickto keep the request as is.
  - There's a reason we met.
- - There's something between us. I can see it.
  - You're not seeing what's above you.
- - Tyrell Wellick's gone.
  - I wake up in his SUV,
- - and the world's about to fall apart.
  - We were there to investigate the hack,
- - and then we were under fire.
  - What you want, I want it, too.
- - Someone's trying to make contact with me.
  - Stage , the femtocell, the back door...
- - I want it shut down.
  - I don't want to shoot you, but I will.
- - I've always told you
  - we'd end up working together, Elliot.
- - Remember the night of the hack?
  - Remember what happened to you?
- - What is it?
  - It's happening.
- - It's almost as if...
  - Something's come alive.
- - Now wait a minute, Elliot.
  - Please, we should talk about this.
- - No!
  - Did you see what just happened?
- - Wait, wait, wait!
  - Do you not understand what just happened?
- - The only thing that happened is the gun jammed.
  - It won't happen again.
- - No, no, no!
  - This is proof. Don't you understand?
- - This is proof.
  - Proof of what?
- - Proof of what?
  - When you told me I couldn't see what was above me, only in front of me.
- - What the fuck are you talking about?
  - We...are gods.
- - You really are a lunatic.
  - You held that gun point blank at me and fired, and yet I'm standing right here talking to you.
- - What are the chances?
  - I don't know.
- - But shit happens all the time.
  - This wasn't chance.
- - This was an act of God.
  - And we have been invited into His circle
- - to lead this revolution.
  - You haven't been invited anywhere.
- - You forced yourself in.
  - There's more to your plan than this.
- - You're smart enough to know that this hack alone isn't gonna kill Evil Corp.
  - Once they realize they can't recover the data, they'll figure out a way to re-create it, and that's where you'll need me.
- - Don't you see it yet?
  - From the first time we met, I felt something between us.
- - This is what I felt.
  - An uncanny connection, a bond.
- - We are meant to work together.
  - That's what this has all been about.
- - Work together? You're a psychopath.
  - How do I even trust you?
- - Pull the trigger again.
  - I'll accept whatever fate decides.
- - Pull it!
  - Okay, Looney Tunes.
- - You're right.
  - There is a second stage to this.
- - After tonight, I don't know what kind of support I'll have.
  - I could use your help.
- - Thank you, Elliot.
  - I love...
- - Some things are better left unsaid.
  - Subtext, you know?
- - Sit down.
  - Take this.
- - You might just be the perfect kind of crazy who can protect me... from me.
  - This his car?
- - Yes.
  - What time did they arrive?
- - Shortly after p.m.
  - This your first time seeing the Swede?
- - This, uh, Tyrell Wellick?
  - Yes.
- - What about the rest of their crew?
  - Nope. No sign of them.
- - Mm-hmm.
  - All right, well...
- - let's go.
  - You know the drill.
- - Let me monologue a little first and hold off on showing the guns, unless they get heroic.
  - Come on.
- - How's that Pontiac treating you?
  - Can't complain.
- - Yeah, well, I told you she was reliable.
  - They'll spend a couple weeks spinning their wheels, trying to decrypt the data.
- - Once that fails, we'll try and collect all the paper records from the local town halls and banks across the country.
  - Titles, deeds, loan records, bank statements...
- - That's our target.
  - I know which teams at E Corp will be tasked with this and their procedures.
- - I'm gonna assume by your funny accent that you're Tyrell Wellick
  - Who the fuck are you?
- - I wouldn't.
  - Mr. Wellick, I'm gonna need you to answer some questions.
- - Did anyone see you come here?
  - Mr. Wellick?
- - Does anyone know you're here now?
  - No.
- - Is that your SUV out there?
  - Yeah.
- - I'm gonna need the keys.
  - What the fuck is this?
- - I will get to you in a moment.
  - Come on, Mr. Wellick.
- - My requests have been pretty simple so far.
  - Phone, too.
- - Do you know how to drive?
  - Yes or no question.
- - Yes.
  - Good. I'm gonna need you to drive to, uh,th and th.
- - Drop his car off at the parking lot there.
  - Put this on the dash. Go ahead.
- - And leave. Make sure no one sees you.
  - And then go home and lie low.
- - Okay? All right, Mr. Wellick, come on. Let's go.
  - No one's going anywhere until you tell me what...
- - If you're seeing me, that means you boys fucked up.
  - Apparently, your friend, James... E Corp IT, I believe...
- - After he completed your honeypot request, he contacted a Gideon Goddard, who reported the incident to the FBI tonight, and then, well...
  - Do I really need to go any further?
- - From what I understand, tonight got a little sloppy joes, if I'm being kind, which I am.
  - And if I say no?
- - Mr. Wellick, pretty soon you're gonna be the most wanted man in the world.
  - There will most likely be a manhunt, the likes of which we haven't seen since bin Laden, given what you two did tonight.
- - Now, I am your only shot at staying out of jail.
  - But, hey, if you want to try to make a go of it on your own, well, that's on you.
- - I'll hightail it out of here quicker than you can finish a box of Swedish Fish.
  - You should go.
- - How long do I have to be here?
  - Not sure.
- - If you absolutely need to contact your wife, we have secure ways of doing it.
  - Just give me some time to work on it.
- - No. No contact.
  - If I'm gonna be here for a while, the more distance I create, the... the better it is for me the better it is for her.
- - That's the only way I'm gonna make it through this.
  - All right.
- - Well, I'll check in on you every couple days, make sure you're okay.
  - You're leaving? So what... what about Elliot?
- - We have work to do.
  - I'm told that's being worked on.
- - I'll need my gun back.
  - If I'm gonna be here alone, I'll need protection.
- - We own acres of the surrounding property, all enclosed by ground sensors and IR motion cameras, wrought-iron gates.
  - This place is like a chastity belt.
- - Nothing's gettin' in.
  - You want to be protected, don't leave the property.
- - Elliot Alderson. Are you Elliot Alderson?
  - Mr. Alderson, you're under arrest for unauthorized use of a computer, computer trespassing, grand larceny...
- - And I would be the greatest job president,
  - ever, in my opinion.
- - So, this is your house.
  - One of your houses, I assume.
- - I've never been to this island.
  - You know, it doesn't even show up on Google Maps.
- - You're going back to New York in minutes.
  - Well, Jesus Christ, you could've called me instead of putting me on a four-hour flight.
- - I got a bad L .
  - I need you to start an image rehabilitation on Tyrell Wellick.
- - He's an ex-E Corp employee who's about to be blamed for the Five/Nine hack.
  - No matter how public it gets, it is important that he stays in a positive light.
- - Huh.
  - Any chance Obama goes after him?
- - People love to defend anything he hates.
  - Also, there's a new narrative I would like you to explore.
- - I need you to put fsociety's origin on Iranian soil.
  - Iran, huh?
- - That's brown enough.
  - Shouldn't be too hard.
- - One last thing...
  - I may have a potential candidate for president
- - I want you to back.
  - Now, I've created tens of thousands of jobs
- - over my career, tens of thousands.
  - Look, the country's desperate right now.
- - But you can't be serious.
  - I mean, the guy's a buffoon.
- - He's completely divorced from reality.
  - How would you even control him?
- - If you pull the right strings, a puppet will dance any way you desire.
  - Right? Make America great again.
- - I say it.
  - Max, he's interfering with the resonator bomb.
- - Stop him!
  - I checked all the elevators, Max, it's not here.
- - It's got to be. Keep looking.
  - Mr. Wellick?
- - I'm Mr. Williams.
  - Please, come, come. Have a seat.
- - Would you like some tea?
  - I brought Soderblandning just for you.
- - No, I'm fine.
  - Are you comfortable here?
- - You have everything you need?
  - No.
- - I've been here four days by myself.
  - What's going on? Where's Elliott?
- - Mm.
  - Where Elliot is is an interesting story, and I've been tasked to come here precisely for that reason...
- - To explain it to you.
  - Please sit.
- - First, I have a few questions.
  - We understand you were working with Elliot...
- - On Stagebefore your bad luck.
  - Is that correct?
- - Yes.
  - And we need to get started on it.
- - E Corp might've already begun the recovery program.
  - We need to start our research
- - We can't squander our lead time like this.
  - Four days is already too long.
- - Yes, well, uh... before we commit our resources to you, I was sent here to confirm your loyalty to our cause.
  - This is something we take very seriously if we're to work with someone at this level.
- - You mean the Dark Army?
  - Of course I will be loyal to you.
- - You're our partners...
  - Did you kill Sharon Knowles?
- - What?
  - Did you kill Sharon Knowles?
- - I'm not sure I understand.
  - Don't look away.
- - Look at me. Did you kill Sharon Knowles?
  - What does this have to do with...
- - Did you kill Sharon Knowles?
  - No.
- - Do you love your wife?
  - What is this?
- - Do you love your wife?
  - Of course I do!
- - Have you slept with anyone else since you've been married?
  - Don't look away. Look at me.
- - Have you slept with anyone else since you've been married?
  - No.
- - Will you be loyal to me?
  - Yes.
- - Were you fired from E Corp?
  - No, I quit.
- - Are you afraid of becoming your father?
  - What?
- - Do you hate your father?
  - No.
- - Will you be loyal to me?
  - Yes.
- - Did you murder Sharon Knowles?
  - This is enough!
- - Did you murder Sharon Knowles?
  - I said no!
- - Do you hate your father?
  - No.
- - Do you love your wife?
  - Of course I do.
- - Were you fired?
  - No.
- - Will you be loyal to me?
  - Yes!
- - Don't look away. Look at me. Do you hate your father?
  - Are you afraid of becoming your father?
- - This is enough.
  - Were you fired from E Corp?
- - This is enough!
  - Did you murder Sharon Knowles?
- - Will you be loyal to me?
  - Yes!
- - Have you slept with anyone else since you've been married?
  - Have you slept with anyone else since you've been married?
- - Yes.
  - Have you ever cheated on your wife?
- - No.
  - Do you hate your father?
- - Yeah.
  - Were you fired from E Corp?
- - Yeah.
  - Are you afraid of becoming your father?
- - Yes.
  - Did you murder Sharon Knowles?
- - Did you murder Sharon Knowles?
  - Yes, yes, yes.
- - Will you be loyal to me?
  - No, I will not.
- - I will not.
  - But I will always be loyal to Elliot.
- - You'll need to prep Stagefrom here until we establish a more permanent headquarters.
  - We'll get you everything you need to begin reconnaissance.
- - You'll receive a phone and a laptop
  - with a VSAT to a satellite that we control.
- - Further instructions will follow.
  - We're naming this op Red Wheelbarrow.
- - It was Mr. Alderson's request.
  - But you still haven't told me...
- - Where is Elliot?
  - You have a collect call from an inmate
- - at the Queensboro Correctional Facility.
  - This call will be recorded and monitored.
- - Please press one to accept.
  - Hello?
- - Is it really you?
  - Who is this?
- - Bonsoir, Elliot.
  - Death Likes It Hot by Gore Vida... Chapter one.
- - The death of Peaches Sandoe, the midget,
  - at the hands, or rather feet...
- - In the sideshow of the circus
  - at Madison Square Garden...
- - You seem frustrated.
  - It was Elliot. He was acting strange.
- - Doesn't exactly floor me.
  - Come outside with me for a moment.
- - Get a firm stance.
  - Solid grip.
- - Swing through the log!
  - I need to get back to work.
- - You know, if you're not careful, you can lose your mind up here alone.
  - This is the best way to get you centered.
- - Balance is key.
  - Let me walk you through another one.
- - I used to do it as a child.
  - Why'd you ever stop?
- - Because I hated it.
  - Even better.
- - If you could read my mind, love
  - What a tale my thoughts could tell
- - Just like an old-time movie
  - About a ghost from a wishing well
- - In a castle dark
  - Or a fortress strong
- - With chains upon my feet
  - You know that ghost is me
- - And I will never...
  - Here's the femtocell.
- - The malware's already installed.
  - Just need you to mod it and do your thing with the antennas.
- - Cool. I'll hit this up tonight.
  - Tonight?
- - Try now, kid. We're on a schedule.
  - We have some worrywarts back at the house.
- - Training Angela for this hack has been a bitch.
  - What's up? You're acting weird.
- - You ever think about not doing this shit anymore?
  - Just giving it up?
- - I mean, can't we just be a normal couple that complains about the water bill and looks up vacation packages to Budapest?
  - I knew I should've never let you fuck me.
- - Okay.
  - I'm joking, dickface.
- - Look, we're in the eye of a shitstorm, and it ain't slowing down right now.
  - But it will.
- - Maybe then we can discuss Budapest.
  - She's antsy for it, so... make sure you get it back to me soon.
- - She's a job.
  - Always was.
- - If anything gets fucked up, she's protected, you're not.
  - Why are you telling me this?
- - Stop caring about her.
  - Trust me.
- - Bye.
  - That thing needs to go back to the city, ASAP.
- - There's additional code on here.
  - The Android malware... this has nothing to do with our plan.
- - Why am I even discussing this with you?
  - Elliot and I should be working on this together.
- - If we were in the same room, this would've been done.
  - Are you finished?
- - If I could read your mind, love
  - What a tale your thoughts could tell
- - Just like a paperback novel
  - The kind the drugstore sells
- - When you reach the part where the heartaches come
  - The hero would be me
- - But heroes often fail
  - And you won't read that book again
- - Because the ending's just too hard to take
  - How you holding up?
- - Thought this might cheer you up.
  - Help remind you of the old country.
- - Swedish Fish.
  - I take it you've read the news of your wife's divorce.
- - Listen... don't believe everything you read, okay?
  - Those tabloids... They're always full of shit.
- - Look how they almost ruined Richard Gere's life, and he's a damn fine actor.
  - Primal Fear, am I right?
- - No one who's been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the Lord...
  - Deuteronomy .
- - Hey.
  - Thanks for getting me the sunglasses.
- - Comin' out the slums, it's the hoodlums
  - I'm pullin' my gat out on all you bums
- - So bring it on when you wanna come fight this
  - Outlaw, kicking like Billy Ray Cypress Hill
- - Chill, I bust that grill
  - Grab my gat and load up the steel
- - And if you wanna get drastic
  - I'll pull out my plastic Glock, automatic
- - Synthetic material, burial plots in order
  - Heading down to the Mexican...
- - Freeze! Don't move!
  - Let me see your hands.
- - Hands in the air, now!
  - Yep, I'm looking at him right now.
- - Yes, sir.
  - I have the coordinates plugged into my GPS.
- - I should be there in about an hour.
  - Yes, sir. U-FAP. We'll keep this on lockdown.
- - Okay, Mr. Wellick, I need to let you know that you're being detained locally by me for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.
  - I'll be transferring you to FBI custody, where you'll be federally charged.
- - I can't believe it's actually you.
  - I just had a hunch.
- - Do you speak English?
  - You just got me a promotion, you know that?
- - Before the FBI takes you away, I got to get a selfie with you.
  - No one's gonna believe this.
- - You all right?
  - Finally.
- - I was thinking you guys were gonna send the cavalry.
  - You guys and your goddamn cute puzzles.
- - I could've gotten here sooner if you just gave me the address.
  - I had to solve a fucking math problem to figure it out.
- - You're lucky I covered the area and made sure all the leads on Wellick came directly to me.
  - But I wasn't planning on killing a fucking cop.
- - What if he had called it in to the local Barney Fife?
  - I mean, if you had done your job...
- - You got to understand where I'm coming from.
  - Now, I am getting some serious heat at work, which in my world eventually leads to suspicion...
- - Suspicion because of the events you guys created.
  - I dodged a shootout in China.
- - That hasn't gone unnoticed.
  - Why was there a shootout?
- - Who the fuck knows? Because your boss is a maniac.
  - And now, with this FBI hack, it's left us in a shitstorm over Berenstain.
- - shit happens.
  - Today wasn't our best day, but we took care of it.
- - We?
  - I took care of it.
- - Yeah. Right. I forgot.
  - You guys don't give a shit about me.
- - Make sure this doesn't happen again.
  - You fucking weirdo.
- - Hey, don't mind him.
  - He's a little snake...
- - You know, the kind of guy that will slice your throat when you fart.
  - So... you want to tell me what that was all about...
- - Running off like that?
  - You and I... our stories aren't that different.
- - I'm not wanted for the crime of the century.
  - I work a little more subtly.
- - But we're both married to our jobs...
  - Whether by nature or by choice.
- - That said...
  - my boys were everything to me.
- - Problem is, I fucked up.
  - Took too long to realize it.
- - And when my wife left me, she took 'em.
  - What happened?
- - I was lost...
  - As lost as you are right now.
- - And after chopping a fuckload of wood myself, I realized I needed them in my life.
  - But I knew I had to have a lot of patience.
- - And when the time was right...
  - I was able to prove to my wife that I was a good provider... a good father, a good man.
- - Now, tonight, when I get home, my kids are gonna run up and hug me.
  - We're gonna make Jiffy Pop and watch Big Brother together.
- - When all is said and done here, you'll have your chance to fix your situation.
  - And then your wife and son will come running up to greet you at the end of a long day's work.
- - My wife has to see me as someone strong again.
  - She has to know I will fix this.
- - But we have to get this mission back on track.
  - And that can't happen until Elliot and I are reunited.
- - Give me a few more weeks, and I promise... you'll see him.
  - Couldn't close?
- - Nah, he walked.
  - What happened?
- - I'll tell you what happened.
  - You couldn't relate to him.
- - Take my thermos, for example.
  - Yeah, so what? You don't even have kids.
- - Point is, people want a connection.
  - Makes you more trustworthy.
- - You walk around with one of these, and all of a sudden, you're that corny guy who's proud of being a father, helps them buy what you're selling.
  - Ah...
- - Yeah. I'm gonna go in for the night.
  - Next time, make the sale. Eh.
- - James, you are evicted
  - from the Big Brother House.
- - Should we make out?
  - It's been really fun.
- - Whoo!
  - So how'd it go?
- - It was cool. Got to stab up a bunch of neo-Nazi M*therfuckers to death.
  - You know, not that I'm a fan of murderin' and shit, 'cause I respect life and all, but when it come to neo-Nazis...
- - Well, shit, not gonna lie... It was kind of fun.
  - I mean how'd it go with Alderson?
- - Oh!
  - He got his papers.
- - Should be out soon.
  - By the way, get him laid when he gets out, man.
- - Homeboy is wound tighter than a chinchilla's asshole.
  - Go get packed.
- - He's being released.
  - It's perfect. He will love it.
- - Now, I'm giving this back to you for safe keeping.
  - The barrel was jammed. Squib load.
- - Next shot would've blown your hand clean off.
  - Lucky for you, I took care of it.
- - So this is how the meet's gonna go down.
  - We've reached out to Elliot,
- - and you will be given further instructions
  - as soon as he makes contact.
- - Until then, we're gonna need you to stay here
  - so you'll be near the rendezvous point.
- - Now, you'll give our driver the address.
  - He won't know where you're going until you tell him.
- - If you get hungry, just call for room service.
  - Oh, stay away from the windows, okay?
- - We can't take any chances now that we're in the city.
  - Okay.
- - Wait.
  - What about my suit?
- - Tyrell, we discussed this.
  - I need it.
- - It's nonnegotiable.
  - I have to look my best for him.
- - It's in your closet.
  - I still strongly advise against wearing it.
- - You know, this isn't bumfuck nowhere.
  - You get picked up around here, we can't protect you.
- - Mr. Willick, it sounds like someone's here downstairs.
  - I'll be right down.
- - You Elliot?
  - How do you know my name?
- - No Elliot?
  - No, no, okay. Wait.
- - Chambers and Church.
  - We have to be careful now.
- - They said he's going to be okay.
  - You need to sit down.
- - When he wakes up, you shouldn't talk to him.
  - I will handle this.
- - He should be in a hospital.
  - The conditions here aren't suitable.
- - It's... it's...
  - He's in good hands.
- - I don't understand.
  - I don't understand.
- - He and I were meant to be a team, but he kept saying I wasn't real.
  - He said he didn't see me, but I was standing right in front of him.
- - We were talking.
  - So why would he say I wasn't real, hmm?
- - I don't understand.
  - I just don't understand.
- - It was almost as if he were a different person.
  - Tyrell...
- - He is...
  - Tyrell.
- - Huh?
  - There's something that I need to tell you about Elliot.
- - You're right.
  - He sometimes can become a different person.
