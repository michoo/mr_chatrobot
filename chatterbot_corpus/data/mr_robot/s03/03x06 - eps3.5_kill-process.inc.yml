conversations:
- - I need you to keep an eye on me... you're the only person
  - I can trust.
- - This is what democracy looks like!
  - Elliot, I'm working with the FBI.
- - You've been spying on me?
  - The other night, I followed you.
- - He snuck out and met up with Angela.
  - Stage ... I want it to happen on the day of the U.N. vote.
- - It's time Phillip Price's hand got slapped.
  - This morning at a.m.,
- - the Dark Army tried to run Stage .
  - They're trying to blow up the downtown building today.
- - We need to get Tyrell
  - before it's too late.
- - My wife, my son, and I will go to the Ukraine
  - after the plan is complete.
- - I'll get into that.
  - Everybody...
- - This is a zero sum game. Accept the truth.
  - The Recovery building's going to explode,
- - and the people inside right along with it.
  - Angela's the one behind this.
- - I gotta stop her.
  - I got it done.
- - Oh, good.
  - Irving, are you still gonna evacuate the Recovery center?
- - That's been done already.
  - I'm Emily Moss's daughter, Angela Moss.
- - I'm here to discuss the Washington Township case.
  - Dad, what's going on?
- - I'll let you two talk.
  - employees died from similar types of leukemia.
- - Evil Corp killed my mom, and my whole life, I've always wanted justice... for her death.
  - Tell me, doctor
- - Where are we going this time?
  - Is this the ' s?
- - Or ?
  - All I wanted to do
- - I think I've seen this one, yeah.
  - Elliot has these on VHS.
- - Is Elliot here, Mr. Alderson?
  - No, he didn't... He didn't come.
- - Why?
  - Well, I guess he wasn't feeling up to it.
- - I don't wanna be here, either.
  - There's a lot of nice people visiting.
- - Are you sure you don't wanna join the party?
  - We got this cake.
- - Red Velvet.
  - Not hungry.
- - You know, if that were me over there, I would want Elliot and Darlene to come over and talk to me.
  - But I don't want to talk to her.
- - You remember the, uh, Enchantment Under the Sea dance in the first Back to the Future movie?
  - Marty had to push his dad to ask Lorraine to be his date.
- - And if George didn't overcome his fear, they would never have gotten married, and Marty would never have been born, and he would've disappeared from that photograph, right?
  - I guess so.
- - I know it's scary, but I also know that you can do it.
  - Just might need a little push. That's all.
- - Hey, Angela, somewhere down the road, if Elliot needs some help and...
  - I can't be there for him...
- - Just give him a little push too, okay?
  - Okay.
- - You understand?
  - Of course, Emily.
- - Also, I know we discussed it before, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't bring it up again.
  - It's about the anonymous benefactor who keeps...
- - I'll let you two talk.
  - Don...
- - Sorry, did I say something I shouldn't have?
  - Not at all. You're fine.
- - Well, he reached out again, offering to pay for your...
  - That's very nice of him, but I've made my decision.
- - No more treatments.
  - I wanna spend what time I have left with my friends and family.
- - Just know that there's still people fighting for you, for your family.
  - We're gonna continue with the lawsuit and do everything we can in your name.
- - Hey, you.
  - Hi.
- - What do you think of the party?
  - This isn't fun.
- - It's weird.
  - Weird how?
- - It's okay. You can say it.
  - I'm dying.
- - I don't want to.
  - I hate this.
- - I hate all of it.
  - Angela... you know this isn't good-bye, right?
- - No, I know what dying is.
  - You're never gonna see us again,
- - not Dad, not me...
  - Mm, no, listen,
- - I am always gonna be there for you, no matter what.
  - You wanna know what I believe?
- - What?
  - That this isn't the end, that there's another world out there for both of us, that we'll see each other again.
- - And we'll play and dance and... bake and sing.
  - Doesn't that sound beautiful?
- - Will you believe with me?
  - Angela...
- - Attention.
  - Is there something you wanna tell me?
- - This is an emergency...
  - I don't know what you're talking about.
- - I saw you.
  - Therd floor.
- - You were at the code signing machine.
  - What did you do?
- - We need to let today happen.
  - They're blowing up a building.
- - Yes, I know.
  - And you're okay with that?
- - How long have you been working with Tyrell?
  - What did he tell you?
- - None of that matters right now.
  - This whole time... I thought you were helping me, but you've been...
- - You've been manipulating me!
  - This is what you wanted.
- - After today, your revolution succeeds.
  - You just need the courage to see it through.
- - You sound like him.
  - You, you mean.
- - I need to stop this.
  - Today's work, what Whiterose is doing, is going to change everything for the better.
- - You met Whiterose?
  - What the fuck is happening?
- - She's going to save the world, but we need to let her.
  - Save the world?
- - Angela, whatever Whiterose told you is a lie.
  - She's a fucking terrorist, and if you let this happen...
- - Then we're going to look back and see that these consequences were necessary...
  - People are going to die!
- - No, they're going to be fine!
  - Including your father and my mother.
- - What the fuck are you talking about?
  - You're not making any sense.
- - Angela...
  - Listen to me.
- - Whatever you pulled off of that machine, I need you to give it to me.
  - Now.
- - I can't.
  - I don't have it anymore.
- - Where is it?
  - Who did you give it to?
- - Tell me what you know.
  - Where are they operating from? Where's Tyrell?
- - Where the fuck is he?
  - I'm sorry, Mr. Alderson, but are you even allowed to be in this building?
- - I heard you were let go this morning.
  - So much depends upon a red wheelbarrow...
- - Glazed with rain water...
  - Beside the white chickens.
- - Should've put a wire on her.
  - What did you say to him?
- - What I had to.
  - Well, excuse me for doubting you, but you never struck me as a country-first type of gal.
- - I don't like you very much.
  - Ditto.
- - What are you, six?
  - It's him.
- - Pick it up.
  - Elliot, where are you? What's going on?
- - I texted you the address.
  - Is that where Tyrell is?
- - Yes.
  - We need confirmation.
- - Are you sure?
  - Positive.
- - Get the FBI there to stop him.
  - You gotta do it now.
- - Make him come to us. Find out where he's headed.
  - Where are you going?
- - Just take care of Tyrell.
  - Push him. We can keep him safe.
- - Elliot, just please don't do anything stupid, okay?
  - Just come meet me...
- - I gotta go.
  - Elliot, wait.
- - Everything I said this morning and everything I've done...
  - I'm sorry.
- - Call ended. Got the location.
  - It's a restaurant called Red Wheelbarrow.
- - Let's move.
  - Dom, you heard him. He said the info was good.
- - Let's go.
  - What aren't you telling me?
- - Dom...
  - Between the rioters and the police at E Corp's headquarters,
- - I can't connect there.
  - I can't access my back-doored machine, but I need to log in to that UPS, or everything's fucked.
- - Fastest way of connecting is to go into the Recovery building myself.
  - I heard the conversation myself.
- - Our CHS has confirmation.
  - So she had eyes on him?
- - No, not exactly, but...
  - The intel seems credible, sir.
- - We gotta act before Wellick disappears for another five months.
  - Here's what we'll do
- - I'll put surveillance on the location until we have visual confirmation.
  - Surveillance? Santiago, the lead is solid.
- - This is coming from Darlene. This is why we have her.
  - I can't move on the word of a CHS who has basically, so far, given us jack shit, and then disappeared on us for almost a week, without so much as a word.
- - I need something more concrete.
  - If Wellick is there, we have time.
- - He's not going anywhere.
  - Before we send SWAT bashing down doors, let me coordinate with S.O. teams to get eyes on the place.
- - Ask the S.O. ASAC to get aviation in the air.
  - We get confirmation, we go in, we take down Wellick.
- - Dom... we may only get one shot at this.
  - I wanna make sure we do it right.
- - I suppose congratulations are in order.
  - After all our tit-for-tat, you finally got your U.N. vote.
- - Quite the frenetic day for the-hour newshounds.
  - I wondered if you'd make it today, given everything going on at E Corp.
- - An eventful morning indeed.
  - But something told me I shouldn't miss our little... soir√©e, not for the world.
- - Speaking of my dear little, wounded E Corp, I'll be expecting China to sign that economic accord.
  - All will be done by end of day.
- - You have my word.
  - Oh... thank God that's settled.
- - For now, let's... break from our usual brinksmanship.
  - No need to spoil this afternoon.
- - We both won, as intended.
  - It's time to drink and be merry.
- - Good point.
  - Another fine choice of venue by Sergey.
- - Utterly tasteless.
  - I passed that buffoon of an owner in the lobby.
- - You're gonna take him up on his offer
  - to go boating tomorrow?
- - Oh, please, don't remind me.
  - Those swim trunks he insists upon wearing, a bit too snug... and a bit too short, wouldn't you say?
- - Mm. I believe the appropriate term is hanging brain.
  - Good.
- - Good.
  - Sir, it's about Mr. Wellick.
- - Our contact says his location has been compromised.
  - Well, that doesn't change anything.
- - You know what to do.
  - Kill process when an unwanted process is running and you need to terminate it.
- - I need to kill Stagebefore it kills anyone else.
  - Wrap it up. False alarm.
- - We're outta here.
  - Back it up! Let's go.
- - False alarm, folks. It's safe to go back to work.
  - What are they doing? What about my bomb threat?
- - False alarm. Go ahead, go up.
  - Why is everyone going back in?
- - Everything's fine. False alarm.
  - No, it's not safe.
- - You gotta get them out of there.
  - ESU swept the floor. All's clear.
- - Uh, it's, uh...
  - It's... it's safe to go back to work.
- - I called in a bomb threat with no bomb for them to find.
  - There's no tangible explosive.
- - They had no idea what they were looking for.
  - But I do.
- - Folks, you need E Corp I.D. to re-enter the building. Please have them out where we can see them.
  - Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
- - Have your badges out and ready.
  - Let's go. One at a time.
- - Can you give us a status update on the seventh floor?
  - Seventh floor clear. Heading back down to you.
- - I was right.
  - Angela helped them get around my patch and sign their own malware with a cloned HSM.
- - If I can roll it back, the clean version will overwrite Tyrell and Mr. Robot's malware and buy me some time to revoke the stolen keys.
  - A couple of minutes, and we'll be...
- - Why can't I do this?
  - Why can't I start the restore?
- - Ohh!
  - Names are Fattie, Fattina, and Georgie.
- - Georgie was named after my aunt.
  - Lovely woman. Fat fingers, though.
- - What the fuck is going on?
  - Anyway, it's nice to have a customer flag me down.
- - Since / , we haven't had a whole lot of customers.
  - Hey... Stop, stop.
- - What's the problem?
  - You told me Houston on Avenue A.
- - When did I say that?
  - seconds ago.
- - Mr. Robot.
  - I lost time. We know that. But how much did he take?
- - minutes. I can't spare minutes.
  - Stop the goddamn car.
- - Pull over now!
  - If the malware's already loaded, hydrogen is filling up the battery room right now.
- - There are too many factors to predict when it's going to blow.
  - Could be two hours, or it could explode at any second.
- - Why do we always cut these things so damn close?
  - Agent DiPierro.
- - Tell me you have something, Dom.
  - I am sitting here, fucking pins and needles, losing my shit.
- - You know I can't share any information, Darlene.
  - Have you heard anything more from Elliot?
- - No, I've been trying to call him,
  - but he's not answering.
- - Unless you've got more intel that can further this case, I'm hanging up.
  - We gave you this lead.
- - You wouldn't have shit without us.
  - Don't think for a second that I don't know that you're keeping something from me.
- - Given what's at stake, whoever you're protecting,
  - I sure as shit hope they're worth it.
- - Wrong fucking day, girls.
  - You hungry?
- - Yeah, I could eat.
  - No, I mean, do you wanna go get lunch?
- - I can get lunch if you wanna get lunch.
  - I'd be up for it.
- - All right then, I guess we're going to lunch.
  - I don't understand.
- - Why is everyone leaving?
  - They should be monitoring the fallout.
- - Where are Joanna and my son?
  - What time is our flight to Kiev?
- - What is this?
  - What's going on?
- - Everything's gone.
  - m*therfucker.
- - Is Mr. Robot gaining control, or am I losing control?
  - If he has the power to switch, does that mean I do too?
- - Is this a matter of who wants to win the most?
  - Yeah, I agree, this is fucking confusing.
- - Your trip to the Ukraine, it's not gonna work out the way we discussed it.
  - I've got customers, four cooks behind the line, two girls working checkout.
- - No sign of Wellick.
  - We had a deal.
- - I... I found a solution.
  - You... you said you'd bring my family to me.
- - What's going on out front?
  - I've got eyes on the door.
- - Nothing unusual there or nearby.
  - You fucking promised!
- - The plan is happening because of me, and this is how you repay me?
  - I'm afraid the situation is more nuanced than that.
- - shit, there it is again, his presence.
  - Do you feel it too?
- - No, I need more time.
  - At least he didn't get too far this time.
- - Five minutes.
  - I'm narrowing the gap, but still, this isn't one of our bullshit
- - stalemate prison chess games.
  - In this case, a stalemate means Mr. Robot wins.
- - So, this is it?
  - This is how it's going to end?
- - Bathroom's in use. Make that customers.
  - Follow the instructions inside, and then burn them.
- - Well, unless Tyrell's taking a leak, what do you wanna do?
  - I'm gonna eat.
- - You're not going to kill me?
  - Tyrell...
- - I'm sorry.
  - Stay focused. Stay focused.
- - The stronger I am, the better chance I have of...
  - Three more minutes gone.
- - Who knows how many I have to spare?
  - I'm running out of options.
- - Instead of fighting, maybe it's time we talk.
  - The soda fountain's behind you there.
- - Have a seat, and we'll call your number when it's ready.
  - Oh, and here's our loyalty card.
- - Ten wheelbarrows punched, and you get a free milkshake on us.
  - You know, I... I don't get to this neighborhood too often.
- - How long have you been open?
  - A little over six weeks, but if you're talking about the grand opening special, that's over.
- - Just curious. Thanks, hon.
  - I guess he didn't like my note.
- - I need to get to the battery room.
  - Enjoy your meal, ma'am.
- - I got a worker exiting now, red apron.
  - Keep an eye on him.
- - Mom, it's me.
  - Listen, I don't have a lot of time.
- - I need you to stay home for the rest of the day.
  - Don't go out.
- - I'll ship you some Ensure. Just don't go...
  - I'll have it delivered today.
- - Yes, yes, they have same-day delivery now.
  - I promise. Just stay home.
- - I love you too.
  - So, I'm going to move in with my oldest daughter, Louise.
- - We agreed it's best to pool our resources these days, but... ... I don't wanna be a burden.
  - Don't think like that.
- - You know it's the best thing to do.
  - And it doesn't make sense for you to be living all alone.
- - You're probably right.
  - And my... my ulcerated colitis is kicking in again, so it'd be nice to have family around, you know, in case anything happens.
- - You can never be too safe.
  - Did you hear about the melee at E Corp this morning?
- - The whole world's going to hell in a hand basket.
  - Give me your purses, now!
- - Oh!
  - Give it!
- - Ecoin wallet, where is it?
  - Please, please don't hurt me!
- - Please!
  - The fuck you waiting on?
- - Hand over your purse!
  - What's going on? What's in there?
- - There's a fire. I've got smoke coming from the backroom.
  - I'm looking at the floor plan now, and there is no backroom.
- - Last time I ask bitch!
  - Do it!
- - Cred to Op Center. Emergency transmission.
  - Go with your message,.
- - I've got a fire coming from Red Wheelbarrow restaurant,
  - Broadway.
- - Notify ASAC Santiago and / task force
  - of a possible Wellick sighting.
- - Copy that.
  - What are you doing? Give him your purse!
- - Norm, I'm going in. Get around to the backdoor now,
  - in case Tyrell's in there and tries to run.
- - You could've died.
  - No.
- - No one's gonna die.
  - The battery room has a halocarbon
- - fire suppression system.
  - If I can activate it, it'll suck all the oxygen out of the room in seconds, seal all the doors, and create a vacuum, making it impossible to create any kind of spark,
- - which would prevent...
  - The kill command.
- - Here I am, trying to use it to stop this attack while Mr. Robot is trying to use it on me.
  - Does that just mean we cancel each other out, fighting so hard, we end up standing in place?
- - fuck that. I gotta keep moving.
  - Dude, you okay?
- - Yeah.
  - You disobeyed a direct order. I told you, flat out...
- - I already told you it was a site survey.
  - Report me if you want.
- - Then why am I standing in a goddamn basement
  - with the door kicked in?
- - There were signs of a fire.
  - I did my job.
- - I'd do it again, if given the opportunity.
  - Anything else?
- - All right.
  - Look... despite your blatant disregard for chain of command, this was still a win.
- - Wellick was here.
  - The evidence ERT pulls out of this shit hole can only bring us closer to capturing him.
- - Now, we've got task force canvassing the tunnels.
  - If Tyrell is in there, we'll get him.
- - Why don't you head back to the office?
  - When the evidence comes in, you start sorting through it.
- - I can see your big ass eye. Open up.
  - What do you want?
- - Open the goddamn door.
  - Small coffee, black.
- - You got it.
  - I'm gonna head up to the office.
- - You gonna be okay?
  - I'll be up in a minute.
- - You fucked us, bent us over the sink and went to town.
  - You're not making any sense.
- - We're on the same side.
  - No... fuck!
- - Oh, come on, please! fuck!
  - fuck!
- - I saw you manipulating my brother, turning his condition against him.
  - Taking down E Corp was your plan. Remember?
- - Hey... hey!
  - No! Stop the attack!
- - You have to stop the attack!
  - Get on the ground!
- - Listen to me,
  - you have to stop the attack!
- - On the ground!
  - You're the ones who
- - dragged me into this.
  - We didn't ask you to blow up a goddamn building full of people.
- - You don't know what you're talking about.
  - They're evacuating the building.
- - It's gonna happen any second.
  - Please, listen to me, I can help you!
- - Let's go! Go, go, go!
  - Tell me why I shouldn't call the FBI and turn you in.
- - What is it that you really want, Darlene?
  - With all their paper records consolidated there, this is going to mark the official end of E Corp.
- - Folks, get back! Please stop.
  - You can lie to yourself all you want...
- - But when you're alone at night, this shit will haunt you.
  - Trust me on that.
- - Move... move.
  - You don't understand!
- - No, no, no, listen to me,
  - you have to stop the attack!
- - Now, I can have you in handcuffs right now, so I'm giving you one last chance.
  - Convince me not to.
- - People are gonna die!
  - Stop the attack!
- - Go ahead and turn me in.
  - What attack?
- - I know what I'm doing is right...
  - What attack?
- - Holy shit...
  - He did it.
- - We did it.
  - So what now?
- - Am I forever in limbo, not knowing which side I'm really on?
  - And what about Mr. Robot?
- - Does he now understand that Tyrell and the Dark Army have corrupted his alleged revolution?
  - Does he have any fight left?
- - If so, who's he gonna fight?
  - Them or me?
- - There were no paper records in the building, and the Dark Army knew that, so why did they try to go today?
  - What was Whiterose's real plan?
- - Does she know something I don't?
  - Does everybody know something I don't?
- - Reports are still coming in from across the country...
  - I fought so hard to protect the New York facility that I couldn't see the bigger picture.
- - It wasn't a single point of failure.
  - I was.
- - In a series of seemingly orchestrated strikes across the country, a reported buildings owned by E Corp exploded or caught fire.
  - There has been no official confirmation, or even speculation, as to what caused the explosions and fires to occur.
- - Officials with knowledge of the attacks have stated that the death toll is expected to be well into the thousands.
  - Meanwhile, first responders continue to fight fires and sort through the rubble, with the hope of finding survivors.
- - President Obama is scheduled to hold an emergency press conference later this afternoon to address the American public.
  - As of now, no one has...
