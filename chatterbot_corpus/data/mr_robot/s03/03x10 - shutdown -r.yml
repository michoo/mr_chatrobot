conversations:
- - Everywhere I look you're there.
  - That is why I wanted to meet.
- - So I could find out why you are
  - so special to Phillip Price.
- - Why come after me?
  - Your pet project
- - Angela Moss was allowed to continue with her lawsuit
  - which put my plans in jeopardy.
- - We're not safe here. I have to warn her.
  - She has to know what they heard.
- - Ms. Moss. Ms. Moss, I'm gonna need you to come with us.
  - We're ready.
- - My exploit will give me full access
  - to their management interface.
- - Now I own the Dark Army.
  - I suppose there's some banal excuse why a month isn't enough time to get my project shipped to the Congo?
- - Trenton's right.
  - Encryption keys were exported the night of the hack.
- - Why would Romero do this?
  - He did it for the reason we need those keys now
- - in case our revolution failed.
  - Bang!
- - I don't trust him.
  - All of his data's
- - in the FBI evidence storage system.
  - The FBI. The Dark Army has a man on the inside.
- - I'll hit up my contact.
  - We can't trust them.
- - I might have an angle.
  - She was in my home
- - attempting to steal my badge to get on Sentinel.
  - There are files that can help decrypt all of E Corp's data.
- - What's the plan here?
  - She talks like she knows everything.
- - How do you want to proceed?
  - We haven't seen each other in months.
- - We've been battling each other in our own voids.
  - When we were kids, Darlene and I, we made this snowman.
- - That was the day my dad pushed me out the window.
  - You remember when we made Kevin McCallister?
- - Do you want to talk about it?
  - Do you remember when you said
- - Elliot would one day follow in the footsteps of his father?
  - I think it's time he died for us too.
- - Darlene's not responding to any of my texts.
  - If Dark Army's targeting me,
- - then they're gonna target her next.
  - Hopefully, she made it to our rendezvous.
- - Wake up.
  - Let's go. You're coming with me.
- - Finally you guys came to your sen...
  - Dude, what the fuck?
- - Shut up.
  - Are you seriously gonna arrest me right now?
- - I told you we can fix this, okay?
  - Let's just log into Sentinel.
- - I said shut the fuck up.
  - It's the EC and from last night, the Alderson case.
- - I just submitted it for upload.
  - Why are you giving me this?
- - Um, sorry, Santiago must not have told you.
  - You're on the Alderson arrest.
- - I brought her in last night.
  - No clue what you're talking about.
- - I'm headed to JFK in.
  - Got a flight to San Fran today.
- - Santiago!
  - What are you doing?
- - Taking her to holding.
  - I thought you were putting Agent Kaz on this.
- - Why are you doing this yourself?
  - The ADIC wanted her in holding.
- - That's what I'm doing. Get back inside.
  - Fine, I'll take it up with the ADIC then.
- - Are you gonna finally tell me what the fuck is going on?
  - I can't talk to you about it, Dom.
- - You're not authorized to know.
  - There's intel you're not privy to that's connected to this.
- - I'd be more comfortable if we took it up with the ADIC.
  - If you want to call him, you can.
- - But I...
  - I just don't want you to embarrass yourself.
- - What?
  - Are you scared of me now?
- - There are cameras everywhere.
  - You really think I'm going to do...
- - She's not here.
  - Mr. Robot's note.
- - If what he said is true and the Dark Army owns the FBI,
  - then maybe she ran into them
- - while she was trying to access Sentinel.
  - shit.
- - Dark Army has dozens of operatives
  - who live in and around Manhattan.
- - Combing through their command and control server
  - is going to take too long.
- - There are over , compromised systems on here.
  - I can't go through every one.
- - I don't even know what I'm searching for.
  - I need something to go on.
- - A name, place, something, anything.
  - Think, think, think. What do I know?
- - Anything you can remember? Any detail?
  - Anything. Tell me something.
- - Don't you get it? She's gonna die.
  - Darlene's gonna die. She's gonna die.
- - She's gonna fucking die like everyone else.
  - I should have never done this.
- - I should have left this alone.
  - I'll never learn.
- - I brought this on myself.
  - I'll never learn.
- - This is on me.
  - This is on me.
- - For how many?
  - One.
- - So, Ferris wheel.
  - Cute touch.
- - I need information from you.
  - You do not get to summon me like you're Ali Baba, squeeze me for information then shove me back in some lamp.
- - Darlene's in trouble!
  - She might already be dead.
- - The whole reason you're in this goddamn mess is because we're not working together, because you refuse to talk to me.
  - I wish that were true.
- - The sick part is...
  - I actually missed you.
- - The only reason we haven't been talking...
  - Is because I haven't let myself.
- - Cause I've been scared of you.
  - The part of... me that is you.
- - Why are we talking now?
  - The buildings.
- - I didn't know about that.
  - If you did, would you have done it?
- - Would you have done it?
  - I would have...
- - I would have found another way.
  - Because as much as there is a part of you in me...there is a part of me in you.
- - Your note on the mirror, what did you mean by it?
  - What do you know?
- - I need to find Darlene.
  - Tell me what you know.
- - The FBI... has a mole.
  - You piece of shit.
- - The attack in China.
  - While you were hiding in your room, knowing the rest of us were getting blown to pieces.
- - Cisco.
  - You helped them get to him before we did, didn't you?
- - And the Tyrell cover-up.
  - You helped frame...
- - Markesh and Biswas.
  - This whole time, we've been punching ourselves in the face because of you!
- - All I know is, if you were put in my position...
  - Nothing would make me betray everything I stand for.
- - You know one thing I'll say about you, DiPierro, your naiveté is adorable.
  - It's easy for you to play a hero in the back seat, but that's all your world's ever amounted to.
- - The back seat.
  - The things I did.
- - I mean, the... the things that I have to do...
  - Are you seriously trying to paint yourself a saint now after what you've put us through?
- - You know, the only reason your girlfriend here is alive is because I never told the Dark Army she was a CHS.
  - Believe or not, I'm not a bad guy, DiPierro.
- - You don't understand what they put me through.
  - What they hold over me, but you will.
- - Soon enough.
  - There's the cocksucker.
- - Dead center.
  - According to Wellick, he's been working both sides the whole time.
- - Probably the reason we didn't get pegged for Five/Nine.
  - We gotta find a way to trace him.
- - Why don't we jump on his desktop?
  - I already did that remotely, nothing useful.
- - Which means whatever we're looking for is physical.
  - Number sets.
- - It's another cipher code.
  - Not this shit again.
- - This has gotta give us a location.
  - Elliot.
- - Just give me a minute.
  - Elliot.
- - Just finished this book.
  - I got it on tape.
- - Didn't care much for the ending.
  - I mean, a story can have a mediocre beginning and middle, and oftentimes it does, but always got to have a wow ending.
- - Otherwise, what's the point?
  - shit.
- - If he's here that means they must have Darlene.
  - Maybe I can manipulate him into helping us.
- - Quick.
  - What do we know about...
- - Whatever scheme you're trying to come up with right now
  - It ain't gonna change the inevitable, so...
- - I strongly recommend you choose the easy way here and come with me.
  - How'd you sleep last night?
- - I didn't.
  - I've been waiting all night.
- - I need to see her as soon as possible.
  - I have important information for her.
- - It's a beautiful day, don't you think?
  - Look.
- - There are people that are trying to stop her.
  - I need to tell her.
- - Oh, I'm just the house manager.
  - But you can discuss that with Mr. Price when he arrives.
- - I thought we'd get some breakfast first.
  - Do you like pancakes?
- - It's this way.
  - Elliot.
- - Don't fucking move.
  - We are walking into some fucking hillbilly shit here.
- - Now, look.
  - I know this is all fucked up, but it's salvageable.
- - There's a lot of clean-up at the FBI you're going to have to take care of for me.
  - Mm-hmm.
- - So this is the plus-one you've been squawking about?
  - You're not turning this around on me.
- - Not after the fucking day I've had, cleaning up your mess once again.
  - I'm over it. You hear me?
- - It's high time you guys start cleaning up my mess for a change.
  - Uh-huh.
- - And by mess I assume you mean her.
  - I know how to fix this.
- - So do I.
  - All right.
- - Come on, Miss, let's go.
  - Leon, you got this?
- - Yeah, I got it.
  - Are you okay?
- - Is that a joke?
  - We're in a fucking barn out in the middle of nowhere with a handful of psychos.
- - No is the answer.
  - Listen, sir.
- - I don't know what you think I did, but...
  - This guy's a liability to you. He's gotten sloppy.
- - You don't have to do this.
  - Dom.
- - My bosses know about everything.
  - There's security camera footage of him kidnapping
- - Ms. Alderson and me...
  - Miss.
- - Stop talking.
  - Hm?
- - Okay, we got two operatives.
  - Leon's pretty good with a knife.
- - What are you thinking?
  - I'm not trying to escape.
- - Elliot, these guys aren't fucking around.
  - Who do you think you're going to talk to out here?
- - Who do you think?
  - Whiterose.
- - You've played that game already.
  - She doesn't want to see you.
- - She's seeing us right now.
  - fuck me.
- - Now wait a minute.
  - Let's just slow things down a bit.
- - We can flip her.
  - She can be very valuable.
- - No way I'm flipping.
  - Dom.
- - Don't be stupid. Listen to me.
  - I'm trying to get you out of this alive.
- - Valuable, huh?
  - You think she would've gone far in the Bureau?
- - She would have been one of the youngest ASACs ever, still could be.
  - No, she's a rising star.
- - Gumption.
  - But it's like she said, no way she's flipping.
- - Hey.
  - Oh, no, no, don't get too worked up, Miss.
- - Just look at the sky.
  - Take a deep breath.
- - Try to enjoy the fresh air.
  - Wait, wait, wait. Dom.
- - Just tell him you'll flip.
  - This isn't worth it. You can...
- - Oh, don't mind that.
  - We're retiring this shit-stain.
- - And you're taking his place.
  - You work for the Dark Army now.
- - You're gonna go back to the FBI.
  - It's gonna be business as usual.
- - You're gonna feed us any information and answer all our requests.
  - fuck you.
- - Now, Dom.
  - You're gonna need to get your head around the position you're in here.
- - I'm no traitor.
  - You should kill me now because the first thing I do when you let me go is arrest your fucking ass.
- - The name of your youngest family member, what is it?
  - Oh, that's right.
- - Four-year-old Jamie DiPierro of Morrisville.
  - That's your brother Joseph's kid, right?
- - Yeah.
  - I want you to look at this jerk-off and imagine it's little Jamie.
- - Now I want you to imagine your mom Trudie... in Philly.
  - Now imagine Uncle Chris one morning as he's picking up his copy... of the Dallas Morning Star!
- - Or you're older brother, Jerry, while he's watching
  - Wheel... of... Fortune!
- - Am I illustrating my point?
  - Dom, I'm going to need verbal confirmation that you're grasping the details of this agreement!
- - Okay.
  - Okay.
- - In time... this will get easier to live with.
  - I promise.
- - Head into the barn and await further instructions on how to clear up Santiago's missteps.
  - Now, forgive me
- - while I take a moment to center myself.
  - This next bunch...
- - These are for me.
  - Jesus, Dom, what happened?
- - Looks like she's just got her initiation.
  - Want some of this catnip, girl?
- - All right. Suit yourself.
  - All right, if we don't figure out a way to get out of here, they are going to kill us.
- - Look around you.
  - They've been instructed to wait.
- - Not act.
  - Wait for what?
- - They're preparing for someone important to come.
  - I took care of everything.
- - As instructed.
  - Everyone's loaded up in the barn.
- - You might want to send your guys to the woodpile over there.
  - I had to kill the FBI mole.
- - That's the bad news.
  - Good news, I got you someone even better.
- - She doesn't have as high of a rank, but she's got tremendous upside.
  - Besides...
- - That guy was a dickhead.
  - Anyway.
- - She's in the barn as well.
  - Where are you going?
- - Me, I'm gonna take that overdue sabbatical
  - I keep talking about.
- - Finally get to finish my book.
  - Well, that's the goal anyway.
- - I'm thinking the Sandals in Barbados.
  - They got a good special running this month.
- - You are not going anywhere.
  - We have work to do.
- - Tell me something.
  - She still making her spontaneous overtures?
- - She make you taste her yet?
  - Remember, doll face, I was you years ago.
- - And I've already done my time.
  - I think she'll be good with me.
- - Glad we did this.
  - I want to leave.
- - My staff not keeping you comfortable?
  - I wouldn't have come if I had known this was your house.
- - I was getting concerned about you.
  - Hadn't been to work for weeks, you're not answering your phone, your emails.
- - I sent someone to your apartment.
  - When I saw what you were doing, I felt I...
- - I had to intervene.
  - I'm not supposed to be here.
- - And where do you think you're supposed to be?
  - You know where.
- - With her.
  - She has a plan.
- - Yes, I've known about her delusional plan for years.
  - You don't know anything.
- - Mr. Alderson.
  - I had a chance to review your paperwork for Stage Three.
- - Surprisingly...
  - It's bullshit.
- - There is no Stage Three, but you already knew that.
  - I'm glad we can be honest.
- - Now we can talk.
  - The only reason you're involved in any of this is because I had Colby hire you.
- - I needed to manipulate you into dropping that contingency from your lawsuit.
  - You were threatening her plant.
- - And she would have done anything to stop those inspections, including killing you.
  - Why would you care if she killed me?
- - You don't care about anyone but yourself.
  - Let go of them.
- - Then we can talk.
  - But if I didn't have her then how am I going to keep you honest?
- - I own everything.
  - I own every single system the Dark Army has compromised.
- - I met your mother.
  - Emily.
- - When you took my laptop, you infected yourself with my malware.
  - If you hurt her, it will all get released.
- - Every bribe, blackmail, extortion, operation, all your illegal connections, everything will go public.
  - The entire Dark Army history.
- - That's impossible.
  - And here I thought we were going to be honest.
- - We were both working at E Corp.
  - We dated for quite some time.
- - Seven days ago, the Russian government hired you to hack the DNC.
  - Elliot.
- - Two days before that, you bribed the president of South Korea to allow backdoors in all of their military networks.
  - You're just pissing him off.
- - Three weeks before that, you used Phillip Price to annex the Congo for China.
  - Am I being more honest now?
- - I loved her.
  - Deeply.
- - But I never told her.
  - If one of us dies, everything gets leaked.
- - Well, we can survive a leak.
  - You can't survive a bullet through your throat.
- - The closer we became, the more I held back.
  - I was cruel to her in that way.
- - It made me feel strong...
  - To torture her like that... Like that.
- - We have an opportunity for both of us
  - to leave with what we want.
- - I know exactly what you want.
  - You want to reverse Five/Nine.
- - And honestly we couldn't care less about that.
  - It's already served its purpose.
- - When she told me she was pregnant, she was very emphatic that her child wasn't going to be raised by a monster, as she put it.
  - No!
- - I also know how to move whatever project you have in the Washington Township Plant to the Congo.
  - While you sit back, missing your deadlines, doing nothing,
- - I've engineered a hack that can solve all of your problems and I'm willing to give it to you.
  - Do you hear me?
- - I can move your projects to the Congo!
  - You'll get what you want!
- - We won't bother you anymore!
  - Sometime after that she met and then...
- - She married your father.
  - Who agreed to raise you as his own.
- - You're very sure of yourself.
  - You are just one hacker.
- - What makes you believe that you are better than an army of people exactly like you?
  - Because I am.
- - I did something in one night you've been trying to pull off for months.
  - I never planned on telling you, until I realized what Whiterose had done to you.
- - Look, it's not possible what she's talking about.
  - Angela, this so-called project of hers, it stems from an obsessive, psychotic denial of reality.
- - Don't do this.
  - Let me help you.
- - I'm sorry, Mr. Alderson.
  - You're good at playing games.
- - But this was simply the wrong hand to play.
  - She has murdered countless people to fulfill this... this ridiculous fantasy.
- - History... is finally coming for you.
  - What is this?
- - I don't believe you.
  - You're lying.
- - I am your father.
  - Biologically speaking, anyway.
- - I think that's you, brah.
  - The Cyber Bombings...
- - All of those people.
  - That was my fault.
- - She used me for that.
  - Your jealousy has always blinded you to Mr. Alderson's value.
- - That is why you can never see my plan through to the end.
  - I have to believe there was a purpose.
- - Pettiness.
  - It was a dig at me.
- - It's that small, unfortunately.
  - You can't believe him.
- - He's... he's lying.
  - Know that I will find you
- - as soon as our project is complete.
  - But for the here and now... our time has come...to an end.
- - No, it's not over.
  - It's not over. It can't be.
- - She was gonna bring my mom back.
  - We were gonna be reunited.
- - You made an offer, cuz.
  - Now it's time to pay up.
- - Please tell me you're not bluffing.
  - What are you gonna do to her?
- - What are you asking?
  - Retribution.
- - I want it.
  - Coast Guard is allowing the shipment of humanitarian aid to Iran.
- - Trust me.
  - It'll work.
- - I'm afraid your only move here...
  - Accept that you've been conned.
- - It's downloaded.
  - Now, you know
- - I ain't got to tell you what they going to do if this don't check out right.
  - It'll check out.
- - You know I've always had faith in you, cuz.
  - Do your thing.
- - Find a way to live with what you did.
  - What do we do now?
- - Undo the hack.
  - Don't think I'm doing this for you.
- - Dom.
  - You are a terrible person.
- - Don't ever convince yourself of anything else.
  - All you deserve for the rest of your life... is pure and utter agony.
- - That'll begin to scratch the surface of how I feel about you.
  - You've taken everything from me.
- - My whole life... is ruined because of you.
  - Live with that.
- - Die with that.
  - The FBI had Romero's keylogger files,
- - but he encrypted them with a password.
  - Thing is, the FBI didn't know Romero.
- - I do.
  - Is this really it?
- - The moment this can all truly end?
  - Reverse everything we've done.
- - Finally bring Five/Nine to an end.
  - This is it.
- - Everything that was typed on those machines at the arcade on the night of the hack.
  - So what'd you find?
- - He didn't do it.
  - Romero was just spying on us.
- - He caught someone else exporting the key data.
  - If he didn't do it, then who the fuck did?
- - Reminder, today's city-wide curfew starts at p.m. this evening until a.m. tomorrow morning.
  - Stay indoors and stay off the streets.
- - Why did you bring up Kevin McCallister?
  - The snowman.
- - When we were in Coney Island, you asked me if I remembered.
  - What was that all about? It felt so random.
- - That was the day Dad pushed me out the window.
  - What are you... What do you mean...
- - Dad pushed you out the window?
  - He was mad that I told Mom about his cancer, and he pushed me out the window.
- - You were young.
  - I guess I never told you.
- - What are you talking about Elliot?
  - I was there.
- - We were in your room looking for a camera when Dad came home.
  - For some reason you freaked out and told me to go hide in the closet.
- - Then Dad came in the room, and all of the sudden you... I don't know. You just snapped.
  - You started swinging your baseball bat, hitting everything.
- - No.
  - That's not what happened.
- - Trust me, I remember.
  - You took your baseball bat and you smashed the window, and then you kept telling Dad you were gonna jump.
- - Elliot, you weren't pushed.
  - You jumped.
- - I don't remember any of that.
  - Well, I'm here to remember for you.
- - This is our stop.
  - I'm gonna ride the train a little longer.
- - Are you okay?
  - I'll get it done.
- - Hey. The email from Trenton.
  - I know she sent it to you because she could trust you.
- - The same as I always have.
  - I'm gonna get off at the next stop.
- - I think you should come with me.
  - It wasn't Romero.
- - It was you who exported the keys.
  - Why?
- - We're close, Elliot.
  - You pull the ripcord now and everything will be for nothing.
- - There was a huge cost to get to this point.
  - I still believe if we hold out a little longer...
- - No.
  - You do this, and they will have won.
- - You really believe undoing this is going to fix anything?
  - Huh? Do you?
- - I mean, who is this really gonna help?
  - Me.
- - I'm doing this for me.
  - I can't live with what I did anymore.
- - And you're wrong.
  - They won't win.
- - Because one good thing came out of all of this.
  - They showed themselves, the top % of the %, the ones in control, the ones who play God without permission.
- - And now I'm gonna take them down.
  - All of them.
- - Whatever happens after this, I want us to keep talking.
  - I want us to be a team.
- - I know I can't force you so...
  - I'm asking.
- - I jumped.
  - I wasn't pushed.
- - Did you know that?
  - We didn't need a story
- - We didn't need a real world
  - We just have to keep walking
- - And we became the stories
  - You asked me before why I did this.
- - We, the damned!
  - The reason is I thought...
- - What if we were wrong?
  - We were you before you even existed
- - Carry on
  - What if there's something we weren't seeing?
- - What if we failed?
  - And after us the flood
- - The real reason is it's...
  - It's because it's what you would've done.
- - You were right.
  - There was a part of you in me.
- - Carry on
  - I never wanted to tell you that because it's not in my nature.
- - It's not why I exist.
  - Only you know why I'm here.
- - On the night of the hack, I transferred the keys from the arcade...to a remote virtual machine on our box at home.
  - I then burned it to a CD.
- - Footprints of snow
  - Blind from the road
- - Hail
  - You'll find the seed data and the algorithm
- - embedded in one of those pictures.
  - We carry on, carry on
- - You'll know the one.
  - Follow us
- - We are one
  - With those two pieces, you should be able to regenerate
- - the keys that were used to encrypt all of E Corp's data.
  - Runs deep and strong
- - Hand to the heart
  - Lips to the horn
- - We can save
  - We can be reborn
- - Head on my breast
  - And with that...
- - Hail
  - You can make it like Five/Nine never happened.
- - This is a reminder, today's city-wide curfew begins at ? p.m. this evening through ? a.m. tomorrow morning.
  - Stay indoors and off the streets.
- - Dude, what the fuck? Slow down.
  - fucking asshole.
- - shit.
  - Like I was saying, this shit has been fucking rough.
- - I hear you. It's hit everybody.
  - Yeah, the difference being when it hits you, you don't have to suck some cuck's shrimp dick to buy a damn sandwich.
- - This is true.
  - I think things are gonna change though.
- - For the better.
  - Soon, so...
- - Hang in there.
  - Hanging's what I do best.
- - But I don't know what you mean.
  - E Corp's in a world of shit.
- - Daddy lost both his homes and his bike 'cause of them.
  - And now this country's attackin' Iran.
- - If anything, this is the calm before the damn storm.
  - Yeah, well...
- - Hold out hope.
  - Trust me. I think...
- - I think E Corp will be able to bring back their lost data.
  - Yeah, well, I hope not.
- - That just means debt's gonna come back.
  - And I certainly don't know how my $ , student loan
