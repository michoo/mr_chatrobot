conversations:
- - You brought me in to manage him, and that's exactly what I've done.
  - I'm gonna get him a job at Evil Corp.
- - Doesn't hurt to have him on the inside.
  - I'm sending shipping requests
- - to the actual facilities, but in the manifest,
  - I'm making it look like all the paper is still
- - arriving in New York.
  - How do you bring justice to a conglomerate as untouchable as Evil Corp?
- - When I met Whiterose, she opened my eyes,
  - and I could see how all of the damage
- - that they've caused could finally be undone.
  - No!
- - Don't you see it yet?
  - We are gods.
- - What's that for?
  - In case Elliot comes back.
- - He sometimes can become a different person.
  - Answer me!
- - Stay away from me, you fucking psycho.
  - I like what you did with the place.
- - Still like mine better though.
  - You ever think about not doing this shit anymore?
- - Can't we just be a normal couple that complains about the water bill, looks up vacation packages to Budapest?
  - Hello, E Corp.
- - Guys back at CART are zeroing in on the guy in the video.
  - We might have a good lead soon.
- - Your job is to get intel from Elliot
  - on Tyrell Wellick.
- - That is the only reason you're not in jail right now.
  - Good job. You get anything from Elliot's computer?
- - Last night he sent an encrypted email with a link.
  - Is that coming from downstairs?
- - Is Darlene home?
  - Everything means nothing to me
- - Everything means nothing to me
  - Everything means nothing to me
- - Hey.
  - I said hey.
- - What's your deal?
  - Come on, dude, I don't have all day.
- - What do you want?
  - Come on, look around you.
- - The entire train is either asleep or drop-dead exhausted.
  - Meanwhile, you're over here river dancing, trying way too hard to pretend like you're in a hurry to get somewhere we both know you don't have to be.
- - Honestly, I don't know what you're saying.
  - You have my wallet.
- - You're batshit.
  - And you're a terrible pickpocket.
- - Take out my wallet.
  - Take it out, now.
- - Open it.
  - There should be a Polaroid inside.
- - Take it out.
  - Look, I didn't take anything.
- - Just take it back.
  - Take out the Polaroid.
- - Was that so hard?
  - Thank you.
- - Wait, what is this?
  - Don't you want your wallet back?
- - It's yours.
  - Why?
- - You stole from me, but I stole from you first.
  - That old lady knitting, that frat dude over there, I stole from them too.
- - Everyone.
  - This whole economic fuckshow is my fault, and everything that's happened to you and everybody else since Five/Nine, that's my bad too.
- - That's not even the cherry on top.
  - I killed a woman.
- - Got her right in the heart with a stun gun.
  - This is me.
- - Wait!
  - Metadata.
- - The story behind the data.
  - Getting information is one thing,
- - but how it was created... Where and by whom...
  - Can often be illuminating.
- - Who the fuck is that?
  - Is Darlene home?
- - No, she's out.
  - This email wasn't for Tyrell.
- - It was for us.
  - fuck me sideways, how do he know?
- - He must've phished us when you went to that URL.
  - shit, shit, shit.
- - Should we bring him in?
  - What if Darlene gets back?
- - Like most pics people post on Instagram or Facebook,
  - they don't realize they just gifted
- - whatever social media site their camera type,
  - phone model, name, and location,
- - all hidden inside the photograph's metadata.
  - Come on, Darlene, pick up the goddamn phone.
- - Oh, Jesus H.
  - She left her phone downstairs.
- - How long ago did she leave?
  - Doesn't matter. She's back.
- - It's over.
  - Our lead asset is about to get burned.
- - Let's bring him in.
  - This guy's time is past due anyway.
- - I never trusted his bug eyes.
  - If we do that, it'll burn Elliot's bridge to Tyrell.
- - It's about to be burned anyway.
  - Where are you going?
- - Don't look at me. Act normal.
  - Elliot phished us. He's in your apartment.
- - Stay cool, don't blow your cover.
  - You said you were leaving town.
- - What are you doing here?
  - Since when do you have an apartment?
- - How can you afford this place?
  - None of your fucking business.
- - Leave.
  - I told you to walk away from this.
- - And I told you to leave.
  - We clearly have communication issues.
- - Let's go. You're coming with me.
  - We have to talk.
- - Not gonna happen.
  - I am not going anywhere with you.
- - Last night, I noticed some extra hardware wired to my monitor's display controller along with a small cellular modem taking screen shots every ten seconds and sending them out somewhere, and now I'm standing here, and I wanna know why the fuck are you hacking me?
  - Take another step, and I will fucking scream.
- - You're not gonna hurt me again.
  - And if it is him that I'm talking to right now, then yeah, I hacked you.
- - I don't trust you, so back the fuck off.
  - Darlene...
- - It's me.
  - Yeah, well, that's a pretty complicated statement coming from you.
- - I'm not gonna hurt you.
  - Dom, get back here now.
- - Audio's useless.
  - He's using a goddamn voice protector.
- - You should've listened to me.
  - He is still here, and you can't keep ignoring it.
- - Doesn't mean you hack me, we don't do that to each other.
  - You wouldn't talk to me.
- - What else was I supposed to do?
  - He's working with them, isn't he?
- - I need to show you something.
  - Mm.
- - I know, I know, ribs for breakfast, but I can't pass 'em up when I'm here.
  - You know, the key is in the moisture.
- - Here, look.
  - See that pink in there?
- - Red Wheelbarrow understands.
  - Mop sauce... That's their secret.
- - Layman's version... Two tablespoons dry rub to one cup apple cider vinegar, maybe beer, depends.
  - Then use a brush to mop the ribs during the cooking process. Delicious.
- - You said we needed to talk.
  - Anyone tail you on the way here?
- - SDRs are now second nature to me.
  - Did three cover stops, nothing.
- - Oh, good.
  - Well, this is just a little Monday morning staff meeting update kind of thing.
- - Today's Friday.
  - It was a figure of speech.
- - Point is I received official word...
  - We go on Septemberth, ten days from now.
- - Now, you know how the boss feels about timetables.
  - You said you can manage those two knuckleheads, and she put a lot of faith in you.
- - I'm assuming you can make this happen.
  - What about the shipping delays?
- - Well, good thing we have our guy on the inside, huh?
  - Help speed things up.
- - Of course.
  - We'll make it happen.
- - Good.
  - I wanna be sure too.
- - We've prepared for an emergency evacuation so no one will be in the building when we go?
  - I'm asking.
- - We have.
  - Keep us on schedule, all will be good.
- - I have to ask...
  - Did Whiterose ever show you?
- - Yes.
  - And you believe in it?
- - Take a look at technology nowadays.
  - It's mind-boggling.
- - Hell, these ribs.
  - You think it was even possible to cook 'em as deliciously as this a hundred years ago?
- - I mean, who knows if this is even real meat?
  - As tasty as they are, I wouldn't be surprised if they grew 'em in a lab.
- - I'm not talking about ribs.
  - My point is, I think anything is possible.
- - Did he do this, or...
  - No, it was me.
- - I had to do a deep search, make sure no one was listening.
  - You were right.
- - Stagewas never called off.
  - Is Tyrell involved?
- - Has to be.
  - They're still trying to blow up the recovery building.
- - I've been monitoring traffic at E Corp, and that led me to an unpatched web server.
  - Talk to me.
- - I'm trying to show you.
  - It's all right here in my research.
- - Why are you monitoring them?
  - You could've taken all of this, sent it in as an anonymous tip,
- - and walked away.
  - It's not that simple.
- - Yes, it is.
  - You don't want to turn them in.
- - Why?
  - Tell me what's going on.
- - I want to be the one that finds them.
  - I need to see where this leads.
- - What does that mean?
  - Elliot, listen to me.
- - This is not who you are.
  - You don't blow up buildings.
- - You don't hurt people.
  - I know.
- - What is this, then?
  - There's something inside me that can't let go of what we started.
- - What we started is over.
  - Before, when I was here, you said you wanted to stop this.
- - I need you to go back to that place.
  - Tell me right now... Can you do that?
- - Yes.
  - Good.
- - So with that in mind and with what you have, how do we find them and just end this once and for all?
  - The best lead we've got is me.
- - She gave me her keys when we were...
  - Landlord never changed the locks, and it's been vacant.
- - So what? You just come in here and hang?
  - I get it.
- - I haven't lost time during the day, but at night...
  - That's when you want me to stay awake and keep watch on the off chance you turn into Mr. Hyde and follow you to Tyrell and the Dark Army.
- - Hey.
  - You're my brother.
- - I'm always here for you.
  - Besides, if you really think this is the best way to find Tyrell...
- - It's weird, but I guess we passed weird a long fucking time ago.
  - I'm in.
- - shit, I have to get to work.
  - Whatever he does, it's not me.
- - I know.
  - Come in.
- - The last thing anyone wants is some...
  - sleazy politician...
- - Oh, please, come.
  - It'll be great.
- - How far is this place?
  - Just around the corner.
- - Oh, right, well, I just wanted to say...
  - Thank you for the Christmas card.
- - You're welcome.
  - Look, I'm so sorry about that day.
- - I came into the room, and he slinked towards me,
  - and there was a fire, and he's the President
- - of the United States, and nothing happened...
  - I promise.
- - And I just felt like such a fool because...
  - FBI, FBI!
- - FBI!
  - On your fucking knees!
- - Hands behind your head!
  - Don't you fucking move!
- - Don't move.
  - Don't you fucking move.
- - I sometimes wonder if I'd died when Tyrell shot me,
  - would my revolution have died with me?
- - At first, I thought the Dark Army saved my life.
  - They didn't though.
- - They saved him, Mr. Robot.
  - And now he's trying to wage a terrorist attack,
- - and that excites me.
  - Why?
- - Darlene's right.
  - I could've tipped off the FBI, given them all this evidence
- - and let them handle it.
  - I could just go back to my new TV
- - and IKEA furniture.
  - What's wrong with me?
- - What's that?
  - Nothing, boring.
- - It's a scan, encrypt, archive.
  - It's the new consolidation.
- - Meeting's next week, I think.
  - That was a terrible lie.
- - There's no way she believes me.
  - Okay.
- - You're still coming to the party tonight, right?
  - I forgot that part of being a corporate drone
- - is going to mandated office functions.
  - Yeah, definitely.
- - I wouldn't miss it.
  - Great.
- - One of these days, you gotta pound that ass, dude.
  - Like, I've been out here splashing everything in sight, but it's starting to feel a little lonely in p-town.
- - Don't let her slip away, all right?
  - I need you on this.
- - We know you posted the fsociety video.
  - With a court order, we got the Vimeo connection logs for the account you used, which led us to your IP address and then your home address.
- - That's why you're sitting here.
  - What my partner's trying to say is you're on a path to a hell, and we're not talking the thousand virgins kind.
- - We're talking sharing a prison shower with a few Allah-hating Nazis on the daily.
  - You're young.
- - Don't waste these years behind bars.
  - All you gotta do is tell us who's behind this.
- - Do you know Darlene Alderson?
  - Elliot Alderson, do you know him?
- - Have you ever worked with him?
  - Tyrell Wellick, is he your leader?
- - The tough, quiet kind.
  - Boys in Gitmo find your type especially cute.
- - Whiterose.
  - Is Whiterose your leader?
- - Mr. Nouri, when I get bored, I get very teed off, and this silent treatment of yours is a straight-up sedative.
  - So this is the last time I'm gonna ask you, and, I urge you this time, do not bore me.
- - Who is your leader?
  - Fsociety.
- - Just me.
  - Could have fooled me.
- - What's with the Armani Exchange getup?
  - I came from a work party.
- - Copy that.
  - You good for the night?
- - You sure you can stay up?
  - Just did an eight ball, so I'm golden.
- - Maybe we should have some sort of signal when I'm coming and going so you know it's me.
  - How about you just tell me?
- - That's a good signal.
  - Good night. Wait, are you going to sleep?
- - I was gonna walk Flipper first.
  - Cool, I'll come with.
- - Okay, so, just thinking out loud, but, if I do follow him and find Tyrell and the Dark Army and shit goes down, like, bad shit, you'd get vengeance, right?
  - Like, if I die or something, you'll kill whoever did it, and, obviously, I'll do the same for you.
- - Like, like a vengeance pact.
  - Is that even a thing?
- - It can be our thing.
  - You in?
- - fuck yeah, I'm in.
  - Cool.
- - Darlene...
  - I'm sorry.
- - I treated you like shit for weeks.
  - I shouldn't have been pushing you away.
- - You're my fucking sister.
  - I should've believed you.
- - We've got the fsociety video traced right to that asshole's apartment.
  - We got more than half the FBI across the country chasing Tyrell Wellick, and you're asking that yahoo about the mythical Whiterose from the land of Dark Web Fairy Tales?
- - Come on, Dom, Whiterose is a boogie man story for the Dark Army.
  - Groups like these don't have leaders.
- - The Dark Army isn't like any other group.
  - And I'm tired of being the only one that questions their involvement in this.
- - No doubt they're involved, but this video is fsociety to the bone, and ever since we picked up our guy, fsociety chatter is off the charts.
  - Makes sense if they're planning to make good on their threat, and we just snagged one of their operatives.
- - This guy practically handed us his location.
  - I don't like it.
- - Okay, but isn't every Dark Army member trained to pull a trigger on themselves in lieu of getting caught?
  - Why'd he surrender?
- - I checked with the other facilities.
  - Elliot's been rerouting the shipments all over the country.
- - No, no, no, no, no, no!
  - Why am I even surprised?
- - I told you this would happen.
  - You know him.
- - You know he can't be trusted.
  - He's behind the shipping delays.
- - This explains everything.
  - This manifest was a fucking mirage.
- - And on top of that, you've agreed to a new timeline?
  - That was before I knew about all of this.
- - I came here to talk about our options.
  - Options? We have no fucking options!
- - What happened to your perfect plan?
  - You placed him at E Corp to speed up the consolidation, not to stop it.
- - We're worse off than where we started.
  - Why did you even let him work there in the first place?
- - It was the best way to manage him.
  - This doesn't change anything.
- - This can still be salvaged.
  - This is all your fault.
- - No, it's all his fault.
  - The Dark Army needs to know what he's done.
- - You know that you can't tell them.
  - You understand the consequences.
- - And not just for Elliot, for all of us.
  - Well, maybe I can reason with them.
- - Never appeal to a man's better nature.
  - He may not have one.
- - This isn't impossible.
  - We arrange to have the western-most states ship their records by plane.
- - Our trucks will handle the East Coast.
  - We just need to stay focused.
- - Everyone will notice the trucks.
  - It will draw too much attention.
- - If we move the paper over the weekend, we can operate under the radar.
  - In the meantime, I'll have Elliot's access revoked to make sure that he doesn't interfere again.
- - What?
  - You can promise this m*therfucker won't stop us again when he wakes up in the morning?
- - You can talk to me.
  - Okay.
- - Face it, Elliot, if that's who I'm even talking to.
  - We work nights together for over six weeks to prepare this project, but you spend your days ruining all we've accomplished.
- - You, as a person, make no sense.
  - You're a liability.
- - Our goal hasn't changed.
  - I can't follow this back-and-forth anymore.
- - You had one simple directive...
  - To maintain control until the plan was executed.
- - It doesn't work that way.
  - There's no on/off switch.
- - Then tell me, how does it work?
  - Cause I don't even know which Elliot I'm talking to right now.
- - How it works is I am here now.
  - Don't forget whose operation this is.
- - I once thought you to be a god.
  - I loved you.
- - But now I see how foolish I was and how inferior you are.
  - Like a fucking cockroach.
- - You messed up for the last time.
  - I'm taking over. So, no.
- - This is no longer your operation.
  - This is mine.
- - Listen to me, you Swedish scumfuck.
  - This is my revolution.
- - I am the architect. Do you understand?
  - The only reason you are here is because I allowed you to be.
- - Don't forget I could've pulled that trigger twice.
  - He is fucking crazy. I want him out, out!
- - He's unfit to run this op.
  - You okay?
- - Hey.
  - Look me in the eyes and tell me that you're okay.
- - shit.
  - What's happening?
- - He's here.
  - Angela?
- - Why is he here?
  - Hey, it's okay.
- - What are you doing?
  - Calm down.
- - Where am I?
  - Calm down. Everything's gonna be...
- - Please tell me you know what's happening.
  - It's okay.
- - Please tell me you know what's happening.
  - Please, tell me you know what's happening.
- - Tell me you know what's happening.
  - Tell me you have something.
- - Buy me a drink.
  - I've been covering your ass the last week.
- - You disappeared.
  - All I've gotten is one text saying you might have a development, and now you want me to buy you a drink?
- - You almost got me busted by my own brother, remember?
  - Yeah, I'm still butthurt about that, in case you were wondering.
- - And you never told us what you two talked about when he came to the safe house.
  - Yeah, well, maybe I'm just tired of being a traitor.
- - Maybe I just wanna be a normal person for one fucking minute, okay?
  - So how about you buy me... a drink?
- - You know I could get in trouble for meeting up with you like this, one-on-one?
  - You're supposed to be at the safe house.
- - Yeah, well, we tried it your way, and Elliot ended up almost making us.
  - Okay, now we're trying it my way.
- - What'll you have?
  - Bourbon, Eagle Rare, neat.
- - On her tab.
  - Okay, you got your drink.
- - Now tell me what else you got.
  - You said you're from Jersey. What part?
- - I don't have time for Q and As.
  - My way, remember?
- - I need to know what you have.
  - Well, I'll tell you what I don't have.
- - I have no friends.
  - I have no social contact.
- - I have no life because of you.
  - Now, you said you're from Jersey.
- - You don't fucking say.
  - What part?
- - The world-renown town of Teaneck.
  - Siblings?
- - Two brothers.
  - Relationship status?
- - How many of these do I have to go through?
  - Relationship status?
- - Okay...
  - On again/off again with someone, but they're not really the one or anything like that.
- - Ah, the old pronoun game.
  - I experimented with that for a bit.
- - It's all good with me.
  - Thanks for your approval.
- - It'snow. Why the coded dialogue?
  - FBI doesn't approve of muff-divers?
- - Let's just say it keeps things simple.
  - Whatever diddles your skittle.
- - What about you?
  - Well, my last relationship didn't end very well.
- - You were there, remember?
  - shit.
- - This is why I don't do the social thing.
  - Darlene, I get this is tough for you.
- - We've got a lot of intel that says something is happening and soon.
  - From the looks of it, it could be big.
- - We need to get Tyrell before it's too late, which means you need to tell me if you know something.
  - I think I have a lead, but I need to go at it alone
- - without a wire.
  - That's not gonna happen.
- - Well, tough titties, it's the only way
  - I'm doing this, because, when I do this, and you're all popping Cristal after you land Tyrell, understand something...
- - It's game over for me.
  - I may have immunity, but I'm gonna lose my brother.
- - No can do, Kathmandu.
  - This needs to happen by Monday.
- - But I can't work with him anymore.
  - Elliot is dead to me.
- - Our partnership is over.
  - Uh-huh, and...
- - Shipping paper records from buildings across the country to New York over this weekend?
  - It would draw too much attention.
- - That sounds like a YP, not an MP.
  - I don't know what to tell you.
- - Whiterose is strict about her schedule.
  - Be reasonable.
- - I'm back at the beginning.
  - Give me more time.
- - As I said, has to happen on Monday.
  - Why the change in deadline?
- - You knew there were delays.
  - This mad rush isn't worth the risk.
- - You keep squawking as if I'm gonna give you a different answer.
  - Look, you get this done, we all take a nice vacation.
- - I've been looking for some time
  - to finish my book.
- - You don't understand.
  - I lost my partner.
- - We were supposed to be gods together, but it's over.
  - Tyrell, I get that you and Elliot are having interpersonal issues.
- - Sometimes coworkers find that they aren't the right fit, but they still gotta finish the job, you know?
  - Besides, you and I both know this has nothing to do with Elliot being a god.
- - If he is no longer with you, if he cannot finish the job, well, that proves one thing.
  - You are the god, not him.
- - And I am damn confident that you will find a solution to our timing issue.
  - You were destined for this, Tyrell.
- - This is your moment.
  - This is the moment you were born for.
- - You cannot turn away now.
  - Yes.
- - There is a way.
  - First, the baby monitor.
- - I haven't been able to connect in weeks.
  - They must've set up a new system.
- - Regardless, I want to see them in person instead.
  - My wife, my son, and I will go to the Ukraine, together, on Monday after the plan is complete.
- - They don't extradite to the U.S.
  - I want your word.
- - I'll get into that.
  - Okay.
- - Do me a favor and check on Joanna.
  - I've been reading online, and it seems she's been maintaining a low profile.
- - Make sure she's okay and inform her of the plan.
  - Of course.
- - And Irving?
  - There's one last thing I need in order to execute.
- - What's that?
  - The full force of the Dark Army.
- - Your message said this was urgent.
  - I'm coming to you because I don't have just cause for this request, but I need it to happen quickly.
- - Go on.
  - I need you to fire Elliot Alderson.
- - Ban him from any and all
  - E Corp branches and subsidiaries.
- - And why do you want me to fire him?
  - I have my reasons.
- - Explaining them won't help, but my discretion on them is important to me.
  - And you're comfortable making this decision?
- - Mr. Price, I know this random employee doesn't matter to you.
  - He's just a number.
- - You can continue to question me because you seek my true reasons, or you can deny my request because I'm overreaching.
  - But I'll return the favor.
- - You know I'm good for it.
  - If you want my reasons, I'll have to restate
- - what I said.
  - They are mine, and my discretion on them is important.
- - And this is your request?
  - It is.
- - Consider it done.
  - Thank you.
- - You still there?
  - Yes, it's me.
- - Relax, I said it's me.
  - How are you feeling?
- - Are you gonna tell me what happened?
  - We've been over this.
- - Elliot saw everything.
  - I had to knock him out, and now we're here.
- - I was asking about your phone call.
  - We're good to go.
- - Price said yes, but you're staying here this weekend.
  - Can't have any more accidents.
- - He's gonna wake up again.
  - He saw you and Tyrell.
- - He only saw us for a few seconds.
  - Maybe he won't remember.
- - And, if he does, I'll handle it.
  - You just do what you do best.
- - Fight him off.
  - I told you this would happen.
- - I told you that he would find a way to stop us.
  - Stagehas been completely derailed.
- - What is it?
  - Irving.
- - He says we'll be ready to go on Monday.
  - Someone found the future as a statue in a fountain
- - At attention, looking backward in a pool of water
  - Wishes with a blue songbird on his shoulder
- - Who keeps singing over everything
  - Everything means nothing to me
- - Everything means nothing to me
  - Open up.
- - Any day, dude, it's me.
  - In the water showed an iron man still...
- - Elliot?
  - Trying to salute
- - People from a time
  - When he was everything
- - He's supposed to be
  - Everything means nothing to me
