  - Here.
- - All right. Dump them on in there.
  - Come on. You know what to do.
- - Come on, kiddo. Shake 'em up.
  - What? You don't want any?
- - Told you I didn't wanna come.
  - I know, but...
- - It's movie night. Is it the movie?
  - I thought you wanted to see Shallow Grave.
- - I hear it's pretty good.

- - Maybe it's not sold out yet.
  - I wanna go home.
- - How long are you gonna be mad at me?
  - I told you I was sorry.

  - You're just sick and don't want to admit it.
- - You're right.
  - I made some mistakes.
- - I wish I could have been a better father to you.
  - All I'm asking is that you forgive me.
- - Do you think you'll ever be able to do that?
  - No.
- - Yeah.
  - Maybe we should leave.
- - Oh, my!
  - Somebody call !
- - Shh, the movie's about to start.
  - Welcome. Your movie will begin shortly.
- - Please keep our theaters clean
  - by disposing of your trash

- - Gift certificates are also available
  - on special occasions.
- - Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
  - When you delete something,
- - you're making a choice to destroy it.
  - To never see it again.
- - You choose to delete because you need to free up space.
  - Because you don't want it anymore.
- - Because it no longer holds value.
  - Is that what happened to Mobley and Trenton?
- - Were they unwanted?
  - Taking up too much space?
- - You can't keep doing this.
  - What?
- - Why did you wipe-down?
  - Routine.
- - You need to talk to Angela.
  - She is not doing well.
- - Last time I saw her, she was going through a full-on breakdown.
  - I don't care.
- - She should be breaking down.
  - Nice.
- - I recall her being there for you when you had your little episode.
  - Multiple times.
- - Guess I'm an asshole.
  - It's been three weeks.
- - You haven't left your apartment.
  - I'm getting worried about you.
- - Don't.
  - What happened with the attacks, that's not you.
- - Even if it was him, it was me.
  - How do you even know he did this?
- - What does it even matter, Darlene?
  - He got what he wanted. Didn't he?
- - Except, wait a minute. Nope.
  - E Corp's still gonna be just fine because of Ecoin.
- - He sure didn't see that coming, did he?
  - Whoops! Oh, well.
- - Consolation prize, at least we get to be miraculously off the hook for everything.
  - Yes, sure, a couple of good people had to die in disgrace for that. But who's counting at this point? Am I right?
- - I mean, I'm sure he's just doing fucking dandy.
  - If that's what this is about, you can still get rid of him.
- - You don't get it. I tried everything.
  - The medication, therapy...
- - fuck, I even put myself in jail.
  - He won't leave.
- - He won't leave because I wanted this.
  - I liked it.
- - fuck you.
  - You're really scaring the shit out of me right now.
- - I'm not trying to scare you.
  - I just...
- - Just give me some time.
  - I need to find my own way to cope with this.
- - I don't believe you.
  - I feel like...
- - I feel like you're giving up.
  - Just let me stay with you.
- - Okay, that'll make me feel better.
  - Please.
- - I just wanna be alone.
  - Give me some time. Okay?
- - I tell you what.
  - You come by tomorrow, we'll smoke up, and we can watch Careful Massacre.
- - It's not even Halloween.
  - Since when did we start following the rules?
- - I'd like that.
  - Me too.
- - Just for the day. You'd be doing me a big favor.
  - Of course. She's practically family.
- - I'll bring her toys and food over.
  - She likes this purple eggplant thing.
- - I know. You, uh, left it here the last time.
  - And I got food left over, so we're good for the day.
- - Deletion. When you make that decision,
  - there's always that moment of hesitation.
- - That annoying, Are you sure? dialogue box.
  - And then you have to make a call.
- - Yes or no.
  - Yes means ridding myself and the world
- - of Mr. Robot forever.
  - That includes you.
- - There you go.
  - Thanks.
- - Next?
  - Maybe it's something I should have done a long time ago.
- - Next.
  - Don't sigh a sigh for me
- - Don't ever cry for me
  - This is Hard Andy's pure grade, top shelf, all-name-brand supply.
- - No knock-offs or generics. This is all straight from the pharma's assembly line.
  - You got Addys, Exies, Black Beauties, Oxies,
- - Xannies, Roxis...
  - Morphine.
- - Miss Emma.
  - She's good.
- - Those come straight from the manufacturing plant in Jersey. Like I said, Hard Andy's supply is always clean.
  - Pure as a nun's c**t.
- - I'm losing you
  - I'll take it.
- - Perfect.
  - Let me get you a bottle.
- - The whole bag.
  - That's my whole stash.
- - Then you just made an easy sale.
  - Then one day like the tide you began to change
- - Refresh my memory.
  - How do we know each other, again?
- - Referral. We got a friend in common.
  - Take off your shirt.
- - Come on, man.
  - You just did a pat-down outside.
- - I said take off your fucking shirt.
  - See, people don't usually come in here trying to buy Hard Andy's whole stash unless one of three prerequisites are met.
- - One, they got their nose up some fuzz's ass which we will soon ascertain. Pants, also.
  - Two, you're trying to resell in my market.
- - But... you don't strike me as a dummy with a death wish.
  - Spin around.
- - Which leaves three.
  - Life that unbearable, baby?
- - Cute little boy like you. Mmm.
  - The pleasure I could give you.
- - Such a shame.
  - Maybe you do have that death wish after all.
- - What do you want?
  - I was a friend of your brother.
- - Mobley.
  - I mean, Sunil.
- - Get lost, man.
  - Wait.
- - I just wanted to pay my respects.
  - I was wondering if you could tell me where I should go.
- - That fat fuck doesn't deserve respect from anyone.
  - Do you know how much he's damaged my career?
- - My firm is on the verge of firing me.
  - I get that you're going through a lot.
- - But don't believe the lies you read about him.
  - They're not true.
- - It's been all over the news.
  - What, do you think they just make this shit up now?
- - The facts are there.
  - He was working with the Iranians.
- - And I have no doubt he got lured into some bullshit like that. He's been a fuck-up his whole life.
  - I just want to know where I can go to say a few words.
- - Your guess is as good as mine.
  - There's no way I was gonna pay for a terrorist's funeral.
- - This is a reminder that today's city-wide curfew
  - begins at p.m. this evening
- - through a.m. tomorrow morning.
  - Stay indoors and off the streets.
- - This is a reminder that today's city-wide curfew begins at ? p.m. this evening through ? a.m. tomorrow morning.
  - Stay indoors and off the streets.
- - Are you moving?
  - Are you leaving the city?
- - Please, sir. We don't want any trouble.
  - I'm not here to give you any trouble.
- - I just wanted to talk.
  - Please, we just want to leave in peace.
- - I went to school with your daughter.
  - I wanted to say she was a good person.
- - What do you want from us?
  - I want you to know she's innocent.
- - I'm sorry, how did you know my daughter, again?
  - Did you speak with her before she left?
- - Do you know why she went to Arizona?
  - No.
- - I just know her.
  - I know she wouldn't do this.
- - Shama was a victim. Somebody did this to her.
  - This country now blames Muslims for everything.
- - There's no room for us here anymore.
  - Thank you for saying nice things about my daughter.
- - That's a lot of pills.
  - Are you sick?
- - What are you doing here?
  - What are you doing here?
- - Where are your parents?
  - Who cares?
- - I don't need a babysitter.
  - Go home.
- - Leave me alone.
  - I don't know how to go home.
- - What do you mean? Just go back the way you came.
  - Where did I come from?
- - Go down the street.
  - Take the train.
- - I don't know how to do that.
  - Well, how did you get here?
- - I followed you.
  - What are you doing?
- - Sitting here.
  - You don't own the beach.
- - Are you serious, man?
  - Your parents are probably really worried about you.
- - I told you. I don't need a babysitter.
  - Besides, I don't wanna go home.
- - Why do you think my sister didn't do anything wrong?
  - Dude, you can't just stay here.
- - Come on.
  - Come with me.
- - You sure this is a shortcut?
  - It's the way we always go.
- - My sister used to take me this way after prayer.
  - Our mosque is on the way.
- - Where do you pray?
  - I don't.
- - You're lucky. It's so boring, and your face is always up another guy's butt.
  - At the mosque, Shama used to trip whenever she put her shoes back on.
- - I can do it while standing and not fall down.
  - You wanna see?
- - No.
  - That's awesome.
- - Can you do it?
  - Probably.
- - You sure this is the fastest way to your home?
  - I gotta get back to Coney Island.
- - Why?
  - Because I have something to do.
- - What?
  - It's personal.
- - Like what?
  - Let's talk about something else.
- - Like what?
  - Don't worry about it.
- - Why?
  - Where are your parents?
- - They usually leave me home alone when they go out.
  - The door locks automatically.
- - Do you have a phone?
  - Pfft, I wish.
- - Do you know their number?
  - Their phone number.
- - I don't know.
  - Today's citywide curfew begins
- - at p.m. this evening
  - through a.m. tomorrow morning.
- - Do you like TV?
  - No.
- - Do you like horses?
  - No.
- - Do you like Wii U?
  - No.
- - Do you like movies?
  - I used to.
- - I've never been to the movies.
  - My parents say it's too expensive.
- - That sucks.
  - Would you take me?
- - Take you where?
  - To the movies. Duh.
- - No. Can't take you to the movies.
  - I told you I have something I gotta do.
- - Besides, there's probably nothing good playing.
  - If your parents come home and see that you're missing, they'll probably call the cops.
- - How far away did they go? Are they close?
  - Danbury.
- - In Connecticut?
  - That's two hours away.
- - My uncle lives there. He likes to live by the mall.
  - He's bald.
- - This is serious.
  - I can't sit here for two hours.
- - That's what I'm telling you.
  - We should go to the movies.
- - Are you lying to me just so I take you to the movies?
  - No.
- - Mr. Sandman
  - We're only going if something good is playing.
- - Mr. Sandman
  - What's Back to the Future?
- - Can we see The Martian instead?
  - Are you kidding?
- - First of all, The Martian looks like shit.
  - Second of all, you've never seen Back to the Future?
- - No. It looks like an old movie.
  - You don't understand.
- - Today's the day that Marty travels into the future.
  - I've wanted to see this movie on this day since I was your age.
- - So weird that it's today.
  - Why?
- - It won't make sense to you.
  - Why?
- - What are you doing? You just ruined it.
  - This is the best way to eat popcorn.
- - Trust me.
  - Wow. That's good.
- - No shit. Come on.
  - So, what is this film about, anyway?
- - It's hard to explain.
  - It's about going into the future to change the past, then coming back into an alternate present day.
- - No, uh, you can't go into the future to change the past.
  - It's way heavier than that.
- - He goes into the future to change the future.
  - But that allows Biff to change the past, which changes the future again.
- - No, no, it's much simpler than that.
  - It's about how one mistake can change the world.
- - Now seating for Back to the Future Part II.
  - Are you sure we can't see The Martian?
- - Come on. You're gonna love it.
  - But The Martian has% on Rotten Tomatoes.
- - That's because most critics have shitty taste.
  - Excuse the disguise, Marty, but I was afraid
- - you wouldn't recognize me.
  - Would you mind holding my Flux Capacitor for a second?
- - I... I... I gotta clean my glasses.
  - Changed the blood, added a good to
- - years to my life. They also replaced
  - my spleen and colon.
- - What do you think?
  - You look great, Doc.
- - The future. Unbelievable.
  - I gotta check this out, Doc.
- - All in good time, Marty. Were on a tight schedule here.
  - Tell me about my future. I mean, I know I make it big,
- - but what, do I become, like, a rich rock star?
  - Please, Marty. No one should know too much
- - about their own destiny.
  - Right, right.
- - I am rich, though, right?
  - Marty, please.
- - Take off your shirt.
  - Put on the jacket and the shoes.
- - We've got a mission to accomplish!
  - Hey, come on, dude.
- - Have you seen a little boy like this tall?
  - Blue hoodie?
- - Yeah.
  - He peaced out.
- - Ugh, these heels are the pits.
  - I should have gone asLorraine.
- - Ow.
  - What? Try me.
- - I'm looking for a mosque. It's near a playground.
  - Masjid Al Rahman, or The Islamic Society?
- - Come on, we'll figure it out. I have good friends in both places. Come on.
  - What are you waiting for? Get in.
- - Ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave announcement to make.
  - to make. Incredible as it may seem,
- - both the observations of science and the evidence
  - of our eyes lead to the inescapable assumption
- - that those strange beings who landed in the Jersey
  - farmlands tonight are the vanguard
- - of an invading army from the planet Mars.
  - War of the Worlds, huh?
- - Why not?
  - Cause it's about the end of the world.
- - No, that's incorrect.
  - Things get a little fakakta for a while, but at the end, humans actually persevere.
- - Monstrous creatures in the world now seems part of another life.
  - A life that has no continuity with the present.
- - Why did you bail on me at the theater?
  - I would have come here with you, if that's what you wanted.
- - No, you wouldn't. You keep saying you have
  - something you have to do.
- - I do have something to do.
  - Now come on. We're going back.
- - Why did you come to our house?
  - Yo, this isn't cool, okay? I gotta go.
- - Is it that important?
  - Yes.
- - Why?
  - It's none of your business.
- - You're a baby.
  - You're annoying.
- - You are!
  - This is a nightmare.
- - You are!
  - So are you!
- - I wish you were dead!
  - So do I!
- - Sometimes I feel like I...
  - Did something bad that made Shama leave.
- - You didn't do anything wrong.
  - All right. I'm gonna give you five.
- - And then we're gonna go.
  - I'm not going anywhere.
- - Just leave me alone.
  - It wasn't your fault.
- - Or hers.
  - It was mine. All of it.
- - So don't blame her or yourself.
  - You can blame me.
- - You know, you talk about yourself a lot.
  - And you're not allowed to wear shoes here.
- - I'm not gonna trip when I put them back on.
  - We'll see.
- - Did you know I could be
  - President of the United States?
- - Yeah?
  - My sister couldn't be.
- - She wasn't born here.
  - My mom and dad couldn't, either.
- - I'm the only person in my family who could be President.
  - Isn't that cool?
- - If I were President...
  - I would be able to stay here.
- - In the house we live in.
  - I would find a way to bring back my sister.
- - I'd put the real bad guys in jail.
  - And... And I'd make everyone eat Pop Tarts for dinner.
- - And then make everyone be nice to me.
  - So you'd be a dictator.
- - What's a dictator?
  - It's like a really bad President.
- - Can you be President?
  - Probably not.
- - So you're like my sister?
  - You weren't born here?
- - No, I was.
  - Where?
- - New Jersey.
  - Really? Me too.
- - What part?
  - Washington Township.
- - Where were you born?
  - Trenton.
- - Looks like your parents still aren't home.
  - You had the keys this whole time?
- - Thanks for taking me to the movies.
  - Wait.
- - What's your name?
  - Elliot.
- - Thanks, Elliot.
  - Sorry I made you late.
- - Hope you can still do your important thing.
  - Hey, Elliot?
- - Can I see you again?
  - Yeah. Before you go,
- - I'll take you to see The Martian.
  - It's always better to see movies on the big screen.
- - Really?
  - Yeah.
- - Thanks, Elliot.
  - I think you'll like it. Matt Damon is awesome.
- - Stay here.
  - I've got something for you.
- - Because you said you were sick.
  - Bye.
- - You again. What the fuck do you want?
  - You're gonna have a funeral for your brother.
- - A proper one.
  - Okay, dipshit.
- - We're not having a funeral for that waste of space.
  - Your problem is you never knew him.
- - If you did, you'd know he's not
  - capable of that.
- - Get the fuck off my property
  - before I call the cops.
- - I'll go.
  - But before I do, you should probably change your corporate email password.
- - Using your street address,even if it's an old one, isn't the smartest.
  - Don't feel special. I hack everyone.
- - From the emails I found, you and your law firm swapped some shady memos that I don't think the IRS would look too kindly on.
  - What do you think you found?
- - If you don't want me sending them out, make sure your brother gets a funeral.
  - A good one.
- - I want an invite.
  - I'll make sure you get my email.
- - Bullshit.
  - Got these from Hard Andy.
- - One of your shady clients I was talking about.
  - I won't be needing them anymore.
- - The money you make selling them back to him will more than pay for a funeral.
  - Start writing a eulogy.
- - A good one.
  - I'll be in the back listening.
- - It's me.
  - Angela.
- - Come on. Open up.
  - Let's talk.
- - I'm worried about you.
  - I wish I could say something that could snap you out of this.
- - Remember when we used to do our wishing game?
  - We'd close our eyes, and we'd wish for something.
- - Whatever we wanted.
  - We both wished we could get bigger bedrooms.
- - That was a big one.
  - You would always wish for more protractors, which was weird.
- - I would wish for a faster computer.
  - Probably faster modem too.
- - You would wish for better clothes.
  - I didn't really care about that.
- - We both...
  - we both wished we could drive.
- - I just wanted to drive away.
  - We wanted to go on road trips.
- - And eat lots of Sour Patch Kids that we would buy from gas stations.
  - After we made all our wishes...
- - We'd close our eyes really hard, hoping that when we opened them, it'd all come true.
  - And we thought the harder we closed them, the stronger our wishes would be.
- - And even though they never came true, we still liked doing it.
  - Because the ending was never our favorite part, anyway.
- - It was the wishing.
  - I didn't get that at first.
- - You remember what you used to say to me right before we opened our eyes that would make it all better?
  - The time is almost here
- - No matter what happens, we'll be okay.
  - Our dreams will all come true
- - I promise you
  - Cause I can see
- - For miles and miles
  - In time we'll be dancing in the streets all night
- - In time yes everything will be all right
  - That's the thing about deletion.
- - But we're going far
  - You and me, yes I know we are
- - It's not always permanent.
  - In time we'll be dancing in the streets all night
- - In time we'll be dancing in the streets all night
  - There are many reasons why you wanna recover a file
- - you just deleted.
  - When you have that moment of panic,
- - where it hits you, where that thing you thought
  - had no value suddenly becomes important.
- - Where you suddenly find new purpose for it.
  - Our eyes will not be blind
- - You'll see this rain come down
  - Without this sound
- - We can all we can all
  - Maybe there are still things left for me to do.
