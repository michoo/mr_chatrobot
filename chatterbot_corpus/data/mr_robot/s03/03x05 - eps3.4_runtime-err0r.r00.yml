- - Are you okay?
  - Yeah, I'm fine.
- - Hello?
  - Finally, I've been trying to reach you all weekend.
- - Are you at work?
  - Yeah.
- - Don't go anywhere.
  - We need to talk, in person.
- - Meet me downstairs. I'll be there in ten.
  - Okay? It's... it's important.
- - Is everything okay?
  - Everything's fine.
- - Hey... we should grab lunch later.
  - Something isn't right.
- - Like something slipped away from me.
  - What is it?
- - I can't put my finger on it.
  - What am I even doing here?
- - I'm arriving at work. I'm walking toward my cubicle.
  - I'm just on autopilot, running my routine.
- - Did my daily program crash?
  - When code runs, it should run straight through without interruption, until all of its tasks have been completed.
- - Unless something goes wrong.
  - A runtime error.
- - Sometimes, corrupted memory can lead to one.
  - Is that what's happening to me right now?
- - A runtime error?
  - Yo, what up, E?
- - I barely made it past those protesters this morning.
  - I mean, the natives are getting restless.
- - This shit's crazy AF, right?
  - Is it?
- - Hey, uh, so I had a piece of tang this weekend you are not gonna believe, dude.
  - I was unlocking achievements Saturday night that went all the way through to Sunday morning.
- - I even impressed myself.
  - Every morning starts like this, graphic s*x talk.
- - Thankfully, I'm able to tune most of it out.
  - When people talk like this, they're either insecure, or they're full of shame.
- - Which one do you think it is?
  - I, uh...
- - Sorry.
  - shit. That was meant for you.
- - I'm really off today.
  - Uh... I mean...
- - Jesus, Elliot, I, um...
  - You know what, man? fuck you.
- - I'm just trying to brighten up your day with my dope-ass anecdotes, but if you don't appreciate it, I can just sit here in silence.
  - Really?
- - Is this gonna end up being a beautiful accident?
  - Mm, no... no, I'm...
- - I'm sorry, bro. I shouldn't have said that.
  - Spoke too soon.
- - I'm bigger than this, man, and, in a way, what you just said actually helps me, 'cause I've always wondered if people here thought I was just trying to get attention, but I was like, Nah.
  - But I should've started the day off by asking what you did this weekend.
- - He does raise a good question.
  - What did I do this weekend?
- - Instead I'm always just rambling around some bullshit.
  - But you know what, I'm gonna drop some truth on you, dude.
- - Since we're opening up here, I, uh... I've only ever gotten laid twice.
  - Okay, actually, it was / times, but the first time, it was...
- - It was one of those high-end escorts, dude, a courtesan.
  - I saw her at the Plaza Hotel... And actually, she saw me, dude.
- - She totally was hitting on me.
  - It cost me, like, two weeks' pay.
- - Oh, I know what I did this weekend.
  - I rehearsed my proposal.
- - I have a big meeting with the VP of Technology.
  - I've actually never had penetration, dude.
- - I've never penetrated. I just... I...
  - I went to one of those rub and tugs...
- - No, wait, I already had that meeting.
  - That was last week.
- - What happened this past weekend?
  - I just kept thinking she was one of those girls that got kidnapped and was forced to do it.
- - I was, like, thinking of her family the whole...
  - Hey, dude, thanks for letting me confide in you.
- - Uh, just don't tell any of the guys about this. Cool?
  - It's hard what he just did...
- - Yeah...
  - Opening up face-to-face, which is why I probably talk to you.
- - Why is my account locked out?
  - E Corp Help Desk.
- - Hey, I got locked out of my account.
  - Can you do a password reset for me?
- - Can I have your employee number?
  - Please hold.
- - My work email is prompting me for a password.
  - Did someone try to get on the domain
- - as me too many times?
  - Or has E Corp locked me out?
- - Did they discover my shipping hack?
  - I need to check my monitoring server.
- - Hey, Samar...
  - Samar, I got locked out.
- - Can I hop on your machine to check something real quick?
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, go for it.
- - Yeah...
  - Is this that bad feeling I have looming over me?
- - Is this why today doesn't feel right?
  - An update failure.
- - No, this can't be happening.
  - Maybe something's wrong with my dashboard.
- - I need to check the full log.
  - shit. This morning at a.m.,
- - the Dark Army tried to run Stage .
  - My patch stopped them, but it doesn't change the fact they're trying to blow up the downtown building today.
- - Damn, dude, Bobbi from HR is rolling up with Security.
  - Wonder who they're axing.
- - Mr. Alderson, thank you for waiting.
  - I looked into this. It looks like we cannot restore your account at this time.
- - Is there anything else I can...
  - Samar is right. HR is firing someone.
- - Me. fuck...
  - I can't leave the building until I get back on a machine and figure out how they're planning on getting around my patch.
- - Samar, I need you to distract them for me.
  - Wait, what?
- - Help me figure this out.
  - Do not leave me. Stay focused.
- - Excuse me, I had a question for you...
  - We're looking for Elliot Alderson.
- - Do you know where he is?
  - Oh, yeah, yeah, he's on floor.
- - You know, they have the best bathrooms, and he likes to take his morning dump around this time.
  - Samar, you need to be serious right now.
- - We have talked about these micro-aggressions of yours.
  - I am being serious.
- - He told me he was crowning his whole commute.
  - He was just here.
- - We need eyes on Elliot Alderson.
  - Elliot, I didn't know if you'd be here.
- - Janet, I...
  - Great news on your proposal.
- - Starting with the Southwest region this week, all paper records will be digitized locally.
  - I tried to find you on Friday. I... you weren't in.
- - I wanted to congratulate you in person.
  - Before we know it, the database...
- - Did you hear what she said?
  - I wasn't in Friday. Where was I?
- - When did my program halt? Why can't I remember? Wait...
  - Mr. Robot...
- - Mr. what?
  - What day is it today?
- - You know it's gonna be a long week if you gotta ask on a Monday. Is everything all right?
  - Janet, I can't talk right now.
- - There's an I.T. emergency on.
  - Last thing I remember was the E Corp party.
- - That was four days ago.
  - Did Mr. Robot really take over for that long?
- - Don't look up. Security cameras.
  - That's right. Darlene. I remember now.
- - She was supposed to follow me... him.
  - You know what I fucking mean.
- - She must've seen Mr. Robot.
  - Darlene...
- - I can barely hear you.
  - It's a madhouse down here.
- - You were gone all weekend.
  - You left Flipper alone. I had to give him to your landlord.
- - Listen to me. Did you follow me?
  - Did you see him?
- - Okay, just come downstairs.
  - I'm getting fired. I can't leave until I've...
- - Ma'am. Check the stairway.
  - Elliot? Elli...
- - I'm going to get him.
  - All I know is it's been six fucking weeks, and I haven't had a weekend with my son.
- - I did trade the car.
  - I'm taking the subway. So what?
- - I'm picking him up from school today.
  - They cut my access privileges.
- - I completely disagree. I think he definitely loves me.
  - Sir... Sir...
- - Are you gonna really get into that right now?
  - That was one time I told him I hated him.
- - I'm going to attract attention.
  - I have to remain calm.
- - Take deep breaths.
  - Be cool.
- - Don't panic.
  - Slow everything way down.
- - Blend in.
  - Look bored, broken.
- - Get a blank office stare on my face.
  - This is how they do it, isn't it?
- - How they're able to watch the worldfall apart around them?
  - Because to them, this is normal.
- - It's all they know.
  - Maybe I can learn from them.
- - I wish I could see myself through your eyes.
  - Don't you wish you could see yourself through mine?
- - As we step through our code, line by line, debugging it to find the cause of our runtime error.
  - What am I doing?
- - I'm still attracting attention.
  - I'll still get caught,and it'll be painfully slow to watch.
- - This isn't gonna work.
  - We need to find an open space, a network jack.
- - God damn it, it's the start of the work week.
  - Monday morning attendance
- - All of the conference rooms are booked, and all of the cubicles are full.
  - I'll have to get someone off their work station.
- - Here...
  - She's the perfect candidate.
- - Hi, Edie, I'm Henry from I.T.
  - Hello.
- - We've detected you using some unauthorized remote access software to connect to your computer work station from home.
  - Oh, my. That can't be true.
- - Don't worry, I'm just gonna take a look at your machine and perform an assessment to make sure you don't have an unauthorized desktop sharing service installed.
  - Well, I'm gonna have to contest that.
- - I've hardened my install further than the standard configuration, including a restrictive host base firewall rule set, and whitelisting to block unauthorized apps from running.
  - I might've chosen the wrong candidate.
- - I think I know your culprit, though.
  - Fred over there uses GoToMyPC all the time.
- - Let me introduce you.
  - Fred...
- - You loused it up again.
  - Hi, Fred.
- - Henry from I.T.
  - Are you serious?
- - You gotta take a look at my machine now?
  - I just got in.
- - Listen, I just need it for minutes.
  - I'm... I'm backlogged here, man.
- - I got my supervisors giving me deadlines.
  - This isn't a matter of debate.
- - Whatever. I'll be in the break room.
  - Log data from the Dark Army's back-doored machine.
- - They're using this guy's account Frank Bowman.
  - He's a member of the code signing architecture team.
- - This is what they're doing.
  - They wanna sign their own firmware and bypass my patch.
- - If they do that, they'll blow up the downtown recovery building.
  - My only chance to stop it
- - is to get to the hardware security modules, the HSMs.
  - They're on therd floor.
- - No, I haven't seen him.
  - Did he just come in?
- - Hi. How are you?
  - One sec, I'm just finishing up an email.
- - I think that you're in the wrong...
  - Almost finished.
- - All right...
  - Excuse me, very important memo.
- - We should get started.
  - I think you're in the wrong room.
- - I'm sorry, you are?
  - Sean, head of Sales.
- - Sean. Of course.
  - Dave Kennedy.
- - I work with Craig on the Q push.
  - I had longer hair then.
- - Listen, we're on a deadline.
  - We don't have time for this.
- - You are in the wrong room.
  - Well, maybe there's been some confusion, either on your end or mine.
- - What room did you say this was?
  - C...
- - You know, I think that's my room.
  - No.
- - All right, let me check my calendar.
  - Service has been spotty all morning.
- - All right, here it is.
  - Ah, you're right, so embarrassing.
- - Uh, I'm not supposed to be on.
  - Yeah, I'm down one floor,
- - I should've known.
  - We always have chocolate donuts too.
- - Oh, Jesus Christ, you have wasted enough of our time already.
  - We need to get started.
- - You know, Sean, sometimes I get a lot like you, where you have a lot of anxiety, because of a deadline, you know, where you feel pressure, because... something has to get done.
  - And then, all of these damn little unknown variables keep popping up.
- - And when you find yourself at the center of one of those storms, man, you just gotta breathe.
  - Just let go.
- - Get it done.
  - Mr. Alderson!
- - Mr. Alderson!
  - Hey, stop!
- - Mr. Alderson, stop!
  - St...
- - shit, I'm going through the lobby.
  - Security will force me out.
- - What should I do? What would you do?
  - That's right, you never answer me.
- - Is this why I created Mr. Robot?
  - To help me get out of situations like this?
- - At least he interacts with me.
  - If Mr. Robot was here, what would he do?
- - First thing he'd tell you is to stop talking to your imaginary friend.
  - You're not really him, though.
- - Would you stop trying to be so technical about everything?
  - You know if he were here, he'd tell you exactly what he told you when he said to walk away from Vera.
- - This is a zero-sum game. Accept the truth.
  - That building is going to blow up, and there's not a damn thing you can do to stop it.
- - I'll find a way to destroy the HSMs.
  - Once I do that, there'll be no way for the Dark Army to run Stage .
- - How are you gonna do that, huh?
  - You're about to be kicked out, Einstein.
- - So the real question is, can you get to the HSMs before they do?
  - All I need to do is get to the ground floor.
- - Once I'm there, I'll find a way to get back in.
  - With the security they have?
- - I'll tailgate someone.
  - Hate to see it, kiddo, but you'd have better luck tailgating the parking lot at a Yo-Yo Ma concert.
- - They got all their peepers peeled for you.
  - I know my way around.
- - Even if you do get up there, you got Bobbi and her Keystone Cops looking for you.
  - You'll never get away with that.
- - And while you're busy spinning your wheels, trying to prove that piece of wisdom wrong, the recovery building's going to explode, and the people inside right along with it.
  - He's right. I need to worry about
- - the people in the building, not the HSMs.
  - But there is no he.
- - That was just my imagination.
  - We haven't seen each other in months.
- - We've been battling each other in our own voids.
  - But at least now I know my next move.
- - This is what democracy looks like!
  - Elliot Alderson, we've been instructed to escort you off the premises.
- - Show me what democracy looks like!
  - This is what democracy looks like!
- - Show me what democracy looks like!
  - This is what democracy looks like!
- - Show me what democracy looks like!
  - This is what democracy looks like!
- - Show me what democracy looks like!
  - This is what democracy looks like!
- - E Corp Recovery Center.
  - How may I direct your call?
- - Listen, there's gonna be a buildup of hydrogen in the data center.
  - Sir, I'm having trouble hearing you.
- - Would you like me to connect you...
  - You've gotta get everyone out of the building now.
- - A spark will ignite the hydrogen and bring the whole place down.
  - Have someone look at the battery room for your UPS devices.
- - Sir, UPS?
  - We use E Shipping for our freight services here.
- - Would you like me to transfer you to the warehouse?
  - There's a fucking bomb in your building.
- - Clear everyone out now.
  - Hopefully that gives everyone enough time to get out.
- - Now all I need to do is find a way to...
  - Elliot!
- - You've gotta help me get back inside.
  - I have to tell you something.
- - There's a code signing machine on.
  - We have to find a way to...
- - I'm working with the FBI.
  - After Cisco, when the FBI questioned me, they did more than that.
- - They had everything laid out on this board Us, Angela, Trenton, Mobley, everyone.
  - They had been following our every move for months.
- - They knew everything.
  - And Tyrell, they think he's at the center of it all.
- - Wait... wait a minute.
  - Back up.
- - This... this has been going on since Cisco?
  - You've been working with them? The FBI?
- - Why didn't you tell me?
  - I made a deal for us.
- - All they want is Tyrell.
  - What?
- - What deal?
  - Is that why you hacked me?
- - For them?
  - What's going on?
- - Are you wearing a fucking wire right now?
  - No.
- - No, they don't even know that I'm here.
  - Elliot, I'm telling you the truth.
- - The truth?
  - The truth?
- - You've been working with the FBI behind my back?
  - You've been spying on me?
- - Am I to blame for this?
  - Not telling her how much I miss Mr. Robot?
- - How a part of me may have let all of this happen?
  - The other night, I followed you like you asked me to.
- - He snuck out of the apartment around a.m., and met up with Angela.
  - She knew it was him.
- - I think the two of them have been working with...
  - Tyrell.
- - That's it.
  - My runtime error.
- - I saw her...
  - And him.
- - I was standing in a room... and they were together.
  - Angela is the one behind this.
- - I gotta stop her.
  - Angela's been betraying you?
- - So have you.
  - You kept this from me.
- - You've been trying to play me this whole fucking time?
  - This is what democracy looks like!
- - Show me what democracy looks like!
  - This is what democracy looks like!
- - Show me what democracy looks like!
  - This is what democracy looks like!
- - Four, three, two, one...
  - We are live.
- - This is what democracy looks like!
  - Okay, we've live in five, four, three..
- - Thanks, Jack. I'm here outside E Corp headquarters, and while it's typical to see daily protesters, it's unusual for the crowd to be this size and this vocal.
  - An NYPD official told me they're taking the situation very seriously, and sending in additional units for crowd control.
- - What's less clear is why today.
  - With an all-time high unemployment rate of%, giving many citizens something to march about, most of the protesters I spoke with did give me varying answers as to why they're here.
- - From forced currency changes to corporate greed and corruption,
  - I even had one gentlemen tell me he was here to protest this morning's U.N. vote, that he felt it was somehow connected to E Corp.
- - This is what democracy looks like!
  - Show me what democracy looks like!
- - Settle down!
  - This is what democracy looks like!
- - Everybody!
  - Settle down!
- - Everyone!
  - Settle down!
- - Everyone...
  - Scan your badge.
- - I said scan your badge now!
  - Tensions are running high,
- - as the United Nations vote approaches.
  - While no one can predict whether today's resolution will pass, all five permanent members, China, France, the Russian federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States must be in unanimous agreement for the measure to be adopted.
- - One, two, three, four
  - One, two, three, four, five, six
- - One, two, three, four
  - Five, six, seven, eight
- - One, two, three, four
  - One, two, three, four, five, six
- - Yeah! Got it, whoo!
  - Please stay on your floor.
- - Lock all doors, and find your nearest safe zone.
  - Stay away from elevators and stereos
- - until further notice.
  - This is Angela.
- - Blankenship.
  - Mentor.
- - Walk toward the elevator bank on your floor.
  - There's a package waiting for you at the reception desk.
- - Has your name it.
  - There's something going on.
- - I don't think I can leave my office.
  - That's our distraction.
- - What do you mean your distraction?
  - Get moving.
- - We don't have a lot of time.
  - This is an emergency.
- - Please stay on your floor.
  - What's going on?
- - Ran into a bit of a snag.
  - We're gonna need you to go ahead and have
- - Elliot implement our contingency plan.
  - Elliot?
- - What contingency plan?
  - He needs to get to a computer called a, uh, HSM,
- - make a backup of it.
  - Once we get that, we'll be good to go.
- - Come on, let's go, let's go!
  - I got the package.
- - Good. Take the package to Elliot.
  - It contains all the hardware he'll need.
- - He'll pose as a member of the internal audit team
  - based out of Detroit.
- - Everything he needs to know is on a sheet of paper inside.
  - He'll get it done.
- - Call me when it's finished.
  - Attention, all E Corp employees,
- - this is an emergency.
  - Please stay on your floor.
- - Lock all doors, and find your nearest safe zone.
  - Stay away from elevators and stairwells...
- - Ma'am, what are you doing here?
  - It's not safe for you to be on elevators.
- - I was, um...
  - I'm trying to get to my office on.
- - There's a secure room and a safe zone on with no windows. I'll take you there.
  - Okay. Thank you.
- - As no permanent members of the council voted against it.
  - The draft resolution containedin document S/ / hereby passes, allowing annexation of the Congo by China.
- - I will now open the floor to members that wish to extend...
  - This is Murphy. I'm on elevator .
- - We just lost power.
  - I'm stuck between floors and.
- - Don't worry, they'll sort it out.
  - We'll be fine. What's in the package?
- - Hopefully it's something we can eat.
  - We may be here a while.
- - Hard drives.
  - Probably not the healthiest choice.
- - Here, let me help you with that.
  - Oh, no, it's okay.
- - What the heck is this?
  - It belongs to my direct report.
- - He, uh... he ran out of a meeting and left his badge in a conference room.
  - I'm bringing it back to him.
- - Interesting that your direct report has special access and you don't.
  - You're gonna have to come with me.
- - Attention, all E Corp employees, this is an emergency.
  - Please stay on your floor.
- - Lock all doors, and find your nearest safe zone.
  - Stay away from elevators and stairwells until further notice.
- - I really should, uh, head back to my office.
  - It's actually just right back there.
- - No, no, no, no, no, we're gonna straighten this out.
  - Hey! Over here!
- - Douchebag!
  - Hey, over here!
- - Go, go, go!
  - Attention, all E Corp employees.
- - This is an emergency.
  - Please stay on your floor.
- - Lock all doors,
  - and find the nearest safe zone.
- - Stay away from elevators and stairwells until further notice.
  - This is the police!
- - Do not attempt to cross the line.
  - This is the police.
- - Do not attempt to cross the line.
  - Where's the USB key?
- - Attention, all E Corp employees...
  - Oh, fuck... Come on, come on, there's gotta be one around here somewhere.
- - Hey.
  - fuck, you scared the shit out of me.
- - Sorry.
  - Have you seen what they're doing out there?
- - It's insane.
  - Yeah, I know.
- - You okay?
  - Yeah, I am now.
- - Wait...
  - How did you get in here?
- - I'm a part of the internal audit team, out of Detroit.
  - Was in the middle of an unannounced physical security audit of the code signing operation.
- - Oh...
  - Ah, you fucking bitch!
- - Oh...
  - Ah...
- - Oh, thank God.
  - Yeah...
- - Attention, all E Corp employees, this is an emergency.
  - Attention, all E Corp employees,
- - this is an emergency.
  - Please stay on your floor.
- - Lock all doors, and find your nearest safe zone.
  - Stay away from elevators and stairwells
- - until further notice.
  - Yeah!
- - This great country didn't start out with states, so why stop at states?
  - And, let me add, that this is why we need a man with a business acumen like Donald Trump as President.
- - If China makes another move like they did today, our standing as a world superpower will be put into question.
  - Mr. Trump has the drive, the ambition to help us...
- - Marlinspike.
  - Moxie.
- - It's done, but we got a problem.
  - I was made.
- - There was a woman in the CSAT room.
  - She saw me.
- - Wait, why were you in that room instead of Elliot?
  - I couldn't find him.
- - What the hell are you talking about?
  - Your distraction is fucking overkill.
- - I couldn't find him in the middle of a goddamn riot.

  - Yes, yeah, I got it done.
- - Oh, good.
  - There's a delivery man waiting for you at Reception on your floor.
- - Give him the package with everything in it.
