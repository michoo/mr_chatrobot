  - If you're around tonight, come over and tell me about it.
- - Shayla?
  - Vera on phone Sometimes the universe aligns perfectly.
- - Here I am, locked away, still it brings you right to me.
  - I feel the sensation.
- - Fight or flight.
  - It's constant.
- - I should just pick one.
  - I, Elliot Alderson, am flight.
- - I am fear.
  - I am anxiety, terror, panic.
- - Some velvet morning when I'm straight
  - I'm gonna open up your gate
- - Doesn't feel real.
  - You should eat.
- - Not hungry.
  - I don't know what I ordered.
- - I'm sorry.
  - You don't like the guisado?
- - No, it's good.
  - Thank you.
- - What are you thinking about?
  - First time we met.
- - Doesn't feel that long ago.
  - Now look at us.
- - Who would have thought?
  - If I could go back and undo this...
- - You can't.
  - You promised me.
- - I'm gonna get you out of this, okay?
  - Time's up.
- - Let's go.
  - Elliot!
- - Sit down. Sit down.
  - Come with me.
- - Let's go.
  - Hello?
- - The origin of your name.
  - I looked it up for you, bruh.
- - Where are you taking her?
  - Elliot.
- - Brave and true.
  - Did you know the origin of brave evolved from savage?
- - I don't know what this is about, but you need to let her go.
  - You know, funny thing.
- - My name means something similar.
  - Brave traveler.
- - Adventurer.
  - Savage traveler becomes brave traveler.
- - Are we savages, or are we brave?
  - Don't know, bro.
- - Listen to me, man.
  - When I found out you did this, I didn't get angry.
- - I got impressed.
  - Your power.
- - I want it, Elliot.
  - And I want it so bad it makes my dick hard.
- - And I want it today.
  - I don't know what you think I can do.
- - I can't just hack you out of prison.
  - Not all prisons are networked, and even if yours is, it would take weeks to find security holes.
- - Has to be tonight.
  - I got crosshairs on my heart.
- - I don't make it out, I'm dead, and that ain't meant to be just yet.
  - You do your thing, bro.
- - You're asking the impossible.
  - When we cross paths tonight, Elliot, I'ma hug you.
- - Please listen, man.
  - Shayla... this is on me.
- - Okay?
  - You got to let her go.
- - Oh, that?
  - She cool, bro.
- - Trust me, she cool.
  - She'll be there tonight too.
- - It'll be one big happy happy.
  - Hey, Elliot.
- - I love you, bro.
  - Where's Shayla?
- - Man, I'm not gonna tell you again.
  - Stop asking so many questions.
- - Come on.
  - Vera may be out of his mind, but yes, it is possible to hack into a prison's network.
- - Most of them use regular industrial control systems.
  - I'm a blind man to what Vera sees in this dude.
- - Amen. Techie computer hacker genius, my thick Dominican dick.
  - When you have control of that, you basically have control of the cell doors.
- - But what these morons don't know is, it's almost impossible without any research.
  - Time to shine your cojones and get to work.
- - Our only rule do what we say.
  - You violate that dictate, we kill your sweetheart.
- - Yo, Isaac.
  - How my dic-Tate?
- - Shut up, bitch.
  - Dictate.
- - Vera's bro, Isaac.
  - Something about him bugs me, and you know what I like to do when that happens?
- - Hi, I'm trying to reach Mr. Beckett.
  - When would Mr. Lattimer be available?
- - I can come in today.
  - I already told you what it's in reference to.
- - I'm trying again for Mrs. Nayar.
  - Regarding the Washington Township scandal.
- - I may have found some information.
  - Please don't put me on hold again.
- - Happy Monday, Angela.
  - How fun.
- - Thanks.
  - Mm-hmm.
- - I'm Emily Moss's daughter.
  - Angela Moss.
- - I called...
  - Six times.
- - Yes.
  - I'm here to discuss the Washington Township case.
- - I'm listening.
  - You represented the victim's families.
- - 26 families, mine included.
  - I thought with the latest news in the data dumps... the Terry Colby scandal, his covering up the chemical waste spill.
- - Alleged.
  - Well, and documents.
- - Superficial.
  - But if we bring this stronger, more concrete case... you'll see that I have the evidence from the data dumps.
- - Along with further research.
  - Stickies.
- - Oh, and you've highlighted and underlined.
  - This is serious.
- - So, you want to take Internet gossip to federal court and throw it at the strongest conglomerate in the history of civilization?
  - Guy in the suit.
- - Twice convicted of sexual assault, charged again this past weekend.
  - Raped his pregnant girlfriend.
- - Bashed her head in with an Xbox.
  - Claims she cheated during Halo.
- - Yet I have a better chance of defending him.
  - You called back.
- - I called every lawyer from this case, and you're the only one that called me back.
  - shit. shit, shit.
- - Connection closed by remote host.
  - But we had a fish. I was in.
- - The exploit started to run, and then... was it the code?
  - Brah, what's the deal?
- - I got to take her for a walk.
  - Why?
- - Cause she'll piss on the floor if I don't.
  - You think I've a shit about your goddamn floor?
- - I'm just playing, brah.
  - Yeah, you can take her.
- - You hear what I said?
  - I said you can take her.
- - Come on.
  - It's out.
- - Okay, got you.
  - Did she like my little toy?
- - Did you write that exploit yourself?
  - I had an hour.
- - So what, you just pulled code from rapid nine or some shit?
  - Since when did you become a script kiddie?
- - I repeat, I had an hour.
  - Malware detection must have caught it.
- - You fucked me.
  - Hey, don't put this on me, okay?
- - Th is a shit show and you gave me no time to do it right.
  - I can run circles around an ICS given the proper whitepapers and time.
- - Where the hell are you going?
  - I have no problem telling these two douchetools they're gonna have to sit on their pricks till we can find a better solution.
- - You don't understand. These guys are...
  - Assholes?
- - Yeah, I'm gonna tell them what's up.
  - That's what's up, girl.
- - Hmm?
  - Now, let's go.
- - So none of those guys called you back, not even Lattimer?
  - Pussies.
- - I bet they didn't even bother to read the data dumps.
  - But you read them.
- - You know it took me eight years to rebuild my career after our case was dismissed?
  - So, as much as I think is company is evil incarnate... and trust me, they are...
- - You know, it's not worth it.
  - What would it take, hypothetically...
- - What do we need to prove our case?
  - Hypothetically, a reliable eye witness...
- - You know, if you miraculously find someone on the inside to flip.
  - Someone who was there when the decision was may to falsify chemical waste and tells...
- - So, unless you're Facebook friends with one of those assholes, this hypothetical is just that.
  - Let's move on.
- - Where are you working these?
  - You have a boyfriend?
- - How's your dad?
  - I work for a company that doesn't respect me, my boyfriend recently cheated on me, and my father is drowning in debt.
- - I'll see you next time.
  - Okay.
- - Fluorescent lights are hell, no?
  - Was there a change in schedule?
- - I thought I had Spencer next.
  - These interviews, they're just a waste of your time.
- - I mean, you know our regulatory and IP issues inside out.
  - I was thinking we play hooky the rest of the day, hit the back nine.
- - Is that a Vacheron?
  - Patek Philippe Tourbillon.
- - A gift from the Prince of, uh...
  - Oh, does it even matter?
- - But I'm not blowing off my remaining interviews.
  - Look.
- - I know you think you were a shoo-in for CTO, and you're pissed.
  - Probably wishing I'd fall into the subway tracks.
- - So how about you cut the bullshit?
  - I'm afraid your paranoia has gotten the best of you, but, nevertheless, please excuse me.
- - I'll leave you to review your notes before Spencer arrives.
  - Oh, and thank you for dinner.
- - The entire evening was enchanting.
  - The food, the wine, the lovely Sharon.
- - Please tell her I say hello.
  - Did you enjoy the view?
- - What?
  - Do you think she wouldn't tell me?
- - I'm not sure what you're trying...
  - You want to watch me piss too?
- - I've had several glasses of water.
  - Scott, a misunderstand...
- - Happy to pull my dick out for you, if that's your thing.
  - Watching the Knowles family urinate.
- - Hell, I could fly my brother in from Miami.
  - He has the bladder of a small child.
- - You'd probably bust a nut watching him take a leak.
  - I'm not sure what she told you, but if I were you, I would tell her to find more appropriate ways of managing her imagination.
- - Tyrell.
  - I want you to accept a hard truth, right here, right now, in front of me.
- - You are not going to be CTO.
  - I want to see that look wash over your face.
- - It's the only way I know you'll stop playing these silly, silly games.
  - Oh, I am fully aware you're CTO, Scott.
- - I'm not sure what more I can offer you.
  - Wait.
- - Here.
  - I feel bad.
- - After all, you got a child on the way.
  - You need all the help you can get.
- - In fact, this would probably pay off the rest of your mortgage.
  - Aren't you still in that neat little two bedroom in Chelsea?
- - There.
  - That's the look I was looking for.
- - I keep brute force thinking, but it's not working.
  - I need help.
- - Elliot, you in there?
  - shit.
- - Why is she here?
  - Elliot!
- - Let me in.
  - Elliot, you in there?
- - Little blonde bitty.
  - Elliot, hit the buzzer.
- - I know you're in there.
  - Go.
- - Shut her up, and get her the hell out of here.
  - Elliot. Buzzer. Now.
- - What about Darlene?
  - She stays with us.
- - And we'll be watching you, so don't bother trying any dumb shit, you dumb shit.
  - fuck!
- - Do you understand why you're angry?
  - Cause you know I'm right.
- - Hey.
  - Hey.
- - I tried looking for you after Gideon's the other night.
  - Where were you?
- - I had to think about things, you know?
  - We always knew what Evil Corp did.
- - We didn't have the proof, but we knew.
  - We were right about it all along.
- - In fact, that news report wasn't a confirmation.
  - It was a reminder of how angry I am.
- - You remember Nayar, the lawyer on the case?
  - I went to her, Elliot.
- - Listen, Angela, now's not...
  - I have an idea that will change the world.
- - I know it sounds really stupid, but I know how to do it.
  - I think it could actually work.
- - I can't tell you what it is, because...
  - Evil Corp, Angela, Vera, his brother, Darlene, Shayla.
- - This is too much.
  - I should just tell her what she wants to hear.
- - Angela, trust yourself.
  - You'll do what's right.
- - That's all I needed.
  - How's Shayla, by the way?
- - She's... you know.
  - Tell her I say hi.
- - .. have no time to pull off whatever it is you think you're doing.
  - What are you doing here?
- - How did you know?
  - Darlene.
- - These guys aren't playing around.
  - They will fucking kill you.
- - Now wise up, and let's go.
  - Darlene's in there. We can't leave.
- - Okay, then we call the cops.
  - There's no other choice here.
- - It's the only way out of this.
  - I can't call the cops.
- - Shayla will die.
  - Oh, come on.
- - She knew exactly what she was getting herself into.
  - You think his employees have a long life expectancy?
- - She was dead the minute she started working with that maniac.
  - Forget it. It's not happening.
- - This is a zero-sum game.
  - Calculate all the outcomes.
- - If you don't pull off this ridiculous miracle... and odds are, you won't... you die, and so does Shayla.
  - That much we know.
- - But assume for a second that you do pull this off, bust Vera out of prison.
  - Who's to say he doesn't kill you, Shayla, Darlene?
- - It would be in his own best interest to do that.
  - Either way, you all end up dead.
- - It's the only way Vera wins.
  - Zero-sum, Elliot.
- - You're playing a game you already lost.
  - You know I'm right.
- - There's got to be a way.
  - I can think of a way.
- - I get it, kiddo.
  - You want to help people. Watch over 'em.
- - The best thing you can do for Shayla... allow her to become a memory.
  - No.
- - True courage is about being honest with yourself.
  - Especially when it's difficult.
- - There is no plan where both you and Shayla survive.
  - I can think of a way.
- - This new world that we are so close to creating will never be.
  - And that new world, that is success.
- - Fsociety is success.
  - Look at what you accomplished at Steel Mountain.
- - That got us nowhere.
  - You took them down.
- - You won that battle.
  - This... this is failure.
- - This is the old Elliot.
  - The one who turns to morphine, to drugs when he feels weak.
- - A coward who can't face the truth, even though it's staring him right in the face.
  - There's that sensation again.
- - Fight or flight.
  - Three lives at stake, including my own.
- - I, Elliot Alderson, am... what?
  - Tom Petty, Pink Floyd, Van Halen? What's up, man?
- - You ain't got no Drake, no Pitbull, no nothing?
  - Like, what's up? What the fuck?
- - What's up, Rain Man?
  - I'm ready to bust Vera out.
- - I can get into the network.
  - We need to go to the jail.
- - Now.
  - She stays here.
- - No, I'm not leaving you.
  - Don't worry, he's in no position to be giving out orders.
- - Let's go, girl.
  - Remember when the panic would set in and we had a solution?
- - To be honest, I miss that.
  - Life is so much easier when you're numb.
- - What's the plan, bitch boy?
  - First Shayla, now Darlene.
- - Yo, what the fuck?
  - Elliot, what are you doing?
- - Like a hard drive blasted by excessive voltage, my mind is frayed.
  - Close to fried.
- - I can feel the static running through my brain.
  - Serotonin receptors working overtime.
- - I need more time.
  - Tonight, tonight, tonight.
- - More time right now.
  - I'm working on our project as we speak, so it's in your best interest to keep talking with me.
- - At the security desk, my cell phone is running an undetectable activated signal sniffer that will locate any kind of wireless signal in sight.
  - By the time I leave this building, I'll own its network.
- - Good on you.
  - Brave, but stupid.
- - You showed your face, and then I skip out tonight.
  - Who do you think they're gonna finger?
- - I'm opening every cell.
  - That way, they can't trace it back to you or me.
- - Yeah, bro.
  - That's what I'm talking about.
- - Whoo!
  - I told you, didn't I?
- - The universe got big plans for us, bro.
  - Sit back down.
- - When you get out, I realize you're gonna have to split.
  - You won't be able to stay in the tri-state area.
- - Oh, I love this.
  - Go on.
- - Wherever you go, you're gonna need funding to keep surviving.
  - Which means your whole operation still needs to be making you money.
- - Come on, Elliot. Give it to me.
  - I hacked Isaac's phone.
- - He had everything. Your crew, shipments, the entire operation.
  - I took it all. I own your whole world.
- - I need your word.
  - When this goes down, Shayla and I go free.
- - You leave us alone.
  - Forever.
- - If anyone tries to hurt us, if I even see one of your guys following me, I leak everything.
  - You're saying this knowing...
- - You can kill me anytime, yes.
  - That's why I coded the leak to auto-send every 24 hours unless I continuously disable it.
- - No one else has access.
  - If anything happens to me or Shayla, your money gets deleted.
- - Guns up, Vera, let's go.
  - Remember.
- - I'ma hug you.
  - So what's your deal?
- - I'm hear to see Terry Colby.
  - Who is that, another damn reporter?
- - No comment. Do you understand?
  - Do I know you?
- - Get the hell away from my home.
  - Get away from my home.
- - WPA2 Wi-Fi?
  - shit.
- - Borderline unhackable.
  - Getting that handshake could take days.
- - The noose is tightening.
  - The mobile feed on the cameras.
- - I don't need to hack WPA2 when there's dedicated 4G.
  - We're good.
- - I can pull this off.
  - Get in.
- - Let's go, girl.
  - Nah, just him.
- - Yo, Isaac, what you doing...
  - Nah, bro, it's fine.
- - I just want to have a private chat with him.
  - Come on, it's cool.
- - We don't have any time, man.
  - I got to get to work.
- - Get the fucking in the car.
  - Yo man, where you going, what you doing?
- - All good, all good.
  - Just gonna have a talk.
- - Are you doing?
  - Why are you doing this?
- - I can free your brother.
  - I figured it out.
- - It just wasn't your day, bruh.
  - I hacked your whole operation.
- - If you kill me...
  - You don't get it.
- - Like I said, it just wasn't your day.
  - Stop.
- - I suppose a bullet through the brain is peaceful in its own right.
  - You don't want me to free Vera.
- - That's why you don't care about the operation.
  - I'd pick better last words.
- - You're trying to kill him.
  - That's why Vera wants to leave tonight.
- - That's what's been bugging me about you.
  - You never wanted me to break him out.
- - Your best option for survival is to kill him in prison, because if you don't, you're dead.
  - You're the reason Vera's locked up right now, and he knows it.
- - Doesn't matter anyway.
  - Vera was just gloating about how he got in with the right crew, how he got the jump on some men.
- - He's not worried, man.
  - He's protected now.
- - Bullshit.
  - That leaves you with a zero-sum game.
- - If you don't get him out of jail, he'll have you killed for failing.
  - Only way this works in your favor is for you to kill him first, and you can't do that with him inside anymore.
- - Shut up, m*therfucker.
  - Shut the fuckup.
- - Let me free him.
  - When I break Vera out tonight, you do with your brother what you want.
- - That's the only outcome where you got the possibility of living.
  - It's your best move.
- - What makes you think I still won't kill you afterwards?
  - I don't.
- - I'm just playing my best move.
  - I need 30 to 40 seconds with the patrol car's Bluetooth connection to run the exploit on the PLC.
- - And then?
  - The plan executes at 9 -49.
- - All the cell doors should open.
  - Hey, I wanted to ask you about something.
- - Oh, yeah, what's that?
  - You.
- - Give me a call.
  - We'll grab a drink, talk, whatever.
- - All right.
  - The exploit's on his laptop.
- - Now I need to force-feed it into the jail's network.
  - I like what I hear.
- - I paused the exploit.
  - Drive.
- - Darlene's no longer part of the plan.
  - man on radio We got an alarm going off, east-side exit.
- - What in the hell?
  - Tell you what.
- - We go out, we drink, we dance, see where the night takes us.
  - You sure you want to make that choice right now?
- - I only need to press one key to run the exploit. Or, I can press another and disable the entire plan.
  - I made my move.
- - You make yours.
  - shit.
- - Please move back, miss.
  - I got to get back ASAP.
- - Whatever.
  - Look, I got to come back now. My computer's on the fritz.
- - Let's go to the meet, DJ.
  - If I mis-typed one command, hit one wrong key, the cell doors won't open.
- - And we both know what that means.
  - Did I make a mistake?
- - No, I don't make mistakes.
  - One minute till Vera.
- - For all his insane, inhumane ideas, he does understand the world.
  - The wild savagery of the world.
- - What you need your piece for, bro?
  - Boy Wonder says he's opening all the cells. If some fool tries to rush us, I want to be ready.
- - Hey, what the shit?
  - Power surge caused by all the cell doors opening at the same time.
- - What about security? Sirens?
  - The jail's network will show all cells locked and closed. Alarms are silent for two minutes.
- - Yes. Yes.
  - This shit right here, this shit tastes better than any pussy I ever had.
- - Whoo!
  - DJ, shoot the cocksucker.
- - My own brother.
  - That's what the universe asked of me.
- - To be my brother's keeper.
  - Like Cain after Abel, I'll be a fugitive and wanderer on the earth.
- - Brave fugitive.
  - Brave wanderer.
- - Look how you helped me.
  - That's the kind of bravery I've been talking about.
- - But now... now I want you to look at Isaac.
  - Look.
- - Dead proof.
  - My operation is over.
- - So go on, crash it.
  - Burn it to the ground.
- - Doesn't matter.
  - I'm gone.
- - A spirit.
  - One with all the heavens.
- - All existence.
  - Shayla.
- - Where is she?
  - Keys, yo.
- - Told you you'd get her back, bro.
  - You just didn't realize she was with you the whole time.
