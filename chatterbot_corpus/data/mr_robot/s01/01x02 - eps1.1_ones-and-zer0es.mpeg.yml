conversations:
- - What I'm about to tell you is top secret.
  - Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick.
- - You wanna do these together then?
  - Pure molly.
- - No, Shayla.
  - I need you to come to Allsafe.
- - shit, they're in the network.
  - This is it. Fsociety.
- - They're telling me to leave it here.
  - Who are you?
- - I think you should come with me.
  - Yeah, that's Darlene.
- - You are gonna modify the DAT file.
  - Put Colby's IP in there.
- - You do that, you'll have set in motion the largest revolution the world will ever see.
  - Sources have confirmed the hacks were in part tied to Colby's terminal.
- - Sir, step inside the car.
  - Bonsoir, Elliot.
- - Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank, but give a man a bank, and he can rob the world.
  - It's a bit of a silly expression, actually.
- - A little reductive, but still...
  - I like it, for the same reason most people hate it, because to me it means that power belongs to the people that take it.
- - Nothing to do with their hard work, strong ambitions, or rightful qualifications, no.
  - The actual will to take is often the only thing that's necessary.
- - I'm sorry to bring you in like this.
  - Technically what we're doing might be considered illegal, which is why I'm surrounded by eleven of our most annoying lawyers.
- - Elliot Alderson...
  - I want to offer you a position here at Evil Corp.
- - I want you to head our cybersecurity division.
  - Except I can't officially offer you anything since we have this non-compete with your employer, Allsafe.
- - But if you do this of your own accord... when you do this... you'll be a multi-millionaire within the next five years.
  - What do you say?
- - Can I... Can I think about it?
  - Gentlemen, I need the room.
- - Yes, thank you. Yes, yes.
  - You know, Evil Corp has just named me interim CTO.
- - It won't be long until it's official.
  - I will be the youngest executive this company has ever seen.
- - I should track down these hackers out there just to thank them.
  - In a way, it's kind of, um...
- - What's the word in English?
  - Serendipitous? Right?
- - You know, by the end of the quarter, we're going to revamp our entire network and consolidate our security protocols.
  - We're going to handle everything internally, which means all of our vendors, including Allsafe, will be cut loose.
- - And it's no secret that once Allsafe loses us as a client, they'll be fini.
  - And when that happens, I want you to be where you belong here with me.
- - This is an important choice you're making, Elliot.
  - I just wanted you to know all the facts before you made your final decision.
- - I think I'm happy where I am.
  - Well, I thought I'd ask.
- - Call this number if you need to get in touch with Mr. Wellick.
  - You can call me Mr. X.
- - Come on, you've never seen JFK?
  - Oliver Stone movie?
- - Sir, I gotta be honest. That's embarrassing.
  - Do yourself a favor and watch it.
- - And pay, for Christ's sake.
  - Anyway, you can call me Mr. Sutherland for now.
- - Don't hesitate to reach me when you're ready.
  - We're always close by.
- - I'm gonna set a date right now...
  - No, we're not.
- - For later.
  - I gotta go, thank you very much.
- - You gonna have me up?
  - No.
- - Gonna have me up?
  - No, stop.
- - I'm coming up.
  - No, you're not coming up.
- - Another time. Okay, I gotta go.
  - Come on.
- - Everything all right?
  - Yeah, he's just a creeper.
- - I hate it when your employers can't take a hint.
  - Hey, is your radiator messed up?
- - Because it's like 3,000 degrees in my apartment.
  - Hey, are you okay? You seem off.
- - While we're here, you mind if I reup?
  - A little early to reup, don't you think?
- - I'm deviating from the schedule a little.
  - Whoa, never thought I'd see the day, Mr. Stricty Pants, but okie dokie.
- - Oh, yeah. shit, I'm out of the other ones.
  - No, just the morphine. It's good.
- - Uh, no, you made me promise never to give you these unless I had your Subs.
  - Shayla.
- - No, Elliot.
  - Promises matter, okay?
- - I take this shit to heart.
  - Oh, my God.
- - Fine, but you have to promise me you won't do a lot until I get your withdrawal meds, okay?
  - I'll go see Fernando later or something.
- - No, you have to say it.
  - I promise.
- - Hey, man.
  - What, you think I forgot about you?
- - Trust me, I need you now more than ever.
  - We gotta get to work.
- - Hacking Tyrell Wellick, you'd think it'd be tricky, but it wasn't... Evil Corp's corporate mail servers, they haven't patched anything since Shellshock.
  - He doesn't even use two-step verification.
- - His password was just his wife's maiden name and Sweden's independence date, 6-6.
  - One six away from the obvious, but still, this is bad noob practice.
- - These emails...
  - His life... it's nice, happy, perfect.
- - This doesn't make sense.
  - Did he know I was going to hack him?
- - Did he let me?
  - I'm gonna need to wipe everything.
- - I know, I know, taking more than I should.
  - I'm breaking my rule, but come on, it's an off week.
- - Come on.
  - Yo. My man, you gotta...
- - You gotta deuce it out over here, all right?
  - Yo, you gotta do your business up in here, all right?
- - Hey...
  - You got this. You got this.
- - female news announcer Terry Colby, the chief technology officer of...
  - Terry Colby's arrest is on everyone's mind.
- - Screen. Might as well be the same thing nowadays.
  - How do I go back to work after this?
- - How can I focus on anything?
  - And when's Mr. Robot going to contact me again?
- - What's he waiting for?
  - Did I just destroy a man's life for no reason?
- - I'm gonna talk to HR about a salary bump for you.
  - Oh, please.
- - No, no.
  - Take the raise.
- - It's not gonna be much, but it's the best I can do right now.
  - Elliot...
- - You saved the company.
  - Now...
- - Why didn't you tell me about the DAT file?
  - You could've come in here at any time before the meeting to say you found something, but you didn't.
- - I gotta be honest. I found that kind of curious.
  - Yeah, I didn't know what I had.
- - Could've easily been a junk file.
  - C'mon...
- - You're never sure about anything unless there's something to be sure about.
  - Maybe you don't know me that well.
- - Regardless, I still need you to stay on it, now more than ever.
  - I mean, who knows what these Fsociety hackers are going to do next.
- - What did he just say?
  - What did you just say?
- - The ones working with Colby.
  - Who knows how deep these data dumps are going to get, and Evil Corp is...
- - What're you talking about?
  - There's a twist.
- - You're usually the one a step ahead of me.
  - They hit the mother lode during the breach.
- - Potentially terabytes worth of emails and files.
  - They're threatening to dump everything unless the FBI frees Colby.
- - They released the video this morning.
  - Hello, Evil Corp. We are Fsociety.
- - Over the years, we have been watching you.
  - Your financial abuse of the poor; your corruption of governments; your cover-ups of the murder of innocent, ordinary citizens, all for the sake of a profit.
- - This is why we at Fsociety have decided you must die.
  - We are malicious and hostile. We do not compromise.
- - We are relentless.
  - We will not stop until every tentacle of your evil monstrosity is sliced off at the nerve.
- - But we are also not without mercy.
  - Our latest hack was our last warning.
- - Meet our demands, and we will consider not destroying you.
  - First, release our leader Terry Colby from your illegitimate prison immediately.
- - Second, release all the people of the world from your even more illegitimate prisons of debt.
  - Third, dissolve your corporation and donate all your assets to charities around the world.
- - This proposal is non-negotiable.
  - The people are realizing they don't have freedom of choice so long as you exist.
- - The people are waking up, no longer accepting your economic slavery.
  - Meet these demands, or we will kill you.
- - Consider yourself warned.
  - Play it again.
- - Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.
  - Yo, please buy my CD. Only cost you 20 likes.
- - Yo, it'll give you the feels, y'all, I swear.
  - The CD's free. All's I ask is you Tweet.
- - Help my social media outreach.
  - You know, be like, I want to set up this meeting. It's like a very, like a...
- - Oh, Elliot!
  - Hey, congrats, man.
- - Allsafe is all over the internet today because of you.
  - Dude, we should celebrate. We have this Groupon for four at Morton's on Thursday.
- - This other couple we were going with totally bailed.
  - Why don't you come with?
- - Their steaks are badass. It's $29.95...
  - I'm not sure that Elliot would like that.
- - Yeah, okay.
  - Yeah? Okay. Awesome, man.
- - And, hey, why don't we make it a double date?
  - I heard that you had a girlfriend.
- - Ollie, you weren't supposed to say anything.
  - Babe, it's cool. Elliot's okay with it.
- - Yeah, okay, sure. I... have to go.
  - Um, my neighbor's complaining about the dog barking again.
- - Since when does he have a dog?
  - Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
- - You look like a beautiful couple.
  - Yo, my album just dropped, You like rap, hip-hop?
- - Yo, this shit is deep, lyrical, poetic.
  - Yo, your girl will like this, my man, I swear.
- - Come on, bro, you've been outside our building for two weeks now.
  - All right, you know, I'll take it, if you leave us alone.
- - Thank you, thank you, man, thank you.
  - And I'll tweet, but only if I like it, all right?
- - I only have 48 followers, but it's growing.
  - No doubt, no doubt.
- - Some tastemakers in there so...
  - I feel you, I feel you.
- - Yeah.
  - All right.
- - Yo, I appreciate it, man, really.
  - You guys have a good day.
- - Yeah, you too.
  - Thank you so much. Check track two out.
- - Track two.
  - All right, man.
- - This was never part of the plan.
  - Data dumps? Releasing Terry Colby?
- - None of this makes sense.
  - Need to cut off all ties with Fsociety.
- - Need to disconnect.
  - We need to call in sick and lie low for a...
- - Dude! Jesus Christ! I am naked, asshole!
  - Don't stare at me!
- - Why the hell are you in my shower?
  - Well, I was waiting for you.
- - You were supposed to come last night.
  - Did you forget?
- - Come? Where?
  - It's fine, everyone's coming later.
- - I'm stealing your clothes.
  - My dress has cum stains on it.
- - Jesus, I am just messing with you.
  - My stuff is just in the wash.
- - I'm gonna borrow this for the time being.
  - Oh, by the way, your dog shat on your bed.
- - You gotta walk that thing.
  - Hey, please take Flipper for a while.
- - She probably needs a walk or something.
  - She keeps shitting everywhere.
- - Of course she needs a walk, Elliot.
  - She's a friggin' dog.
- - Yo, I want to stop and get some froyo before we go.
  - Uh, I'll be back later.
- - I owe you.
  - Yeah, big time.
- - How do you know where I live?
  - Why wouldn't I know where you live?
- - I don't know. I don't know where you live.
  - Well, I don't live anywhere at the present.
- - The douche I was dating proposed to me, can you believe?
  - I mean, what an asshole.
- - Anyways, we got into this huge fight, and...
  - What the hell am I doing?
- - This chick is out of her mind batshit crazy.
  - I gotta go back, tell Gideon everything.
- - He'll understand, right?
  - He'll know what to do.
- - It's whatevs. He'll take me back.
  - He's just gotta get over this whole love is forever bullshit.
- - I'll do my disappearing act for a minute, and then he'll come to his senses.
  - male announcer Stand clear of the closing door.
- - You know, it's our thing.
  - Quick!
- - Can she see them, too?
  - What?
- - I like to stay on my toes.
  - Speaking of, that's, like, one of the most annoying things...
- - But what if Tyrell finds out? What will he do?
  - shit, there's basically no scenario in which I'm not getting killed or going to jail.
- - Because I wanted a turtle, and he was like, No...
  - I might need to crash with you for a couple of nights.
- - That's cool, right?
  - Seriously?
- - Fine! I'll crash at Mobley's.
  - Don't love dogs anyway.
- - Especially ones that shit in your bed.
  - I mean, how do you live like that, honestly?
- - How do you go to sleep when you know that there's...
  - For all we know, I could be walking into a trap right now.
- - We could be dead the second I walk through that door.
  - Come on, kid. We got big things in store.
- - Big things.
  - Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.
- - Goddamn ducks.
  - Hey, hey, man!
- - What's... oh. shit, sorry, sorry, dude.
  - Um, okay.
- - Anyway, just, awesome work, man.
  - Really awesome.
- - Right on, man. Right on.
  - Real cool.
- - Great.
  - So now that we're all done going down on each other, can we please hear the plan?
- - Where are we at with Steel Mountain?
  - If I'm not mistaken, these lines aren't 100% safe yet, and we still haven't made the Colby project disappear.
- - Seriously?
  - It's been weeks. Any links or traces would have been owned by now.
- - The lines are clean, Boss, I swear.
  - Thank you.
- - I mean, um... if it makes you feel better, Romero and I can check...
  - Great! Make me feel great.
- - I'm gonna hang back over here, collect my thoughts.
  - Ohh!
- - What's her deal?
  - Ah, she's a complicated woman.
- - Most malware coders are. Am I right?
  - She showed up at my apartment.
- - Why does she know where I live?
  - Let's not focus on her. That'll be like entering a bad K-hole you'll never wake up from.
- - Instead, I need you to focus on the next phase of our project.
  - Comet, the natural gas plant up around Albany?
- - We're gonna blow it up.
  - Why would you blow...
- - Comet plant's right next to Steel Mountain.
  - Which, as you know, is the off-site and data storage facility for every corporation in the S&amp;P, including everyone's favorite...
- - Evil Corp.
  - Bingo!
- - You're gonna destroy their tape backups.
  - They're gonna be looking out for something like that.
- - They've been on high alert ever since the hack.
  - From what I heard, they've caught their hacker.
- - Haven't they?
  - No, they haven't.
- - Tyrell Wellick knows.
  - What they want him to know!
- - He's a corporate robot just like the rest of them.
  - Besides, the entire company is gonna be reeling from all the data dumps we've got in store for them... and man, do we have some goodies.
- - Some good old-fashioned executive racism, sexism, fascism.
  - Trust me, we are gonna ism so much all over them they won't be able to see straight.
- - And asking for Colby's release as ransom was genius.
  - That'll only make his spotlight bigger, keeping it off us.
- - That neat little ditty was Trenton's idea.
  - She may look innocent, but I'd be careful.
- - She's got some Allah Akbar in her.
  - And while all that's going on, you will use your Allsafe security clearance to hack the Comet PLC, increase the pressure, causing a gas pipeline explosion making Steel Mountain go kablooey along with Evil Corp's soul.
- - They know about all this?
  - You're the first.
- - Workers?
  - Anyone living around the plant...
- - They all die?
  - We'll give them a head start.
- - Sound some alarms. They'll be fine.
  - You're blowing up a gas pipeline.
- - The world is a dangerous place, Elliot, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
  - This is war.
- - People will die. C'est la mort.
  - And once we blow up the pipeline, Darlene's worm will kick into high gear at the U.S. data center which you helped to us install, thank you very much.
- - The redundant backups at their eastern data center in China... the Dark Army is covering us on that.
  - Dark Army? Why, man?
- - They got no code. They hack for anyone terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia...
  - Which means they hate U.S. capitalism just as much as anyone.
- - Last but not least.
  - Steel Mountain.
- - The hacker's dilemma. What to do when a bunch of data you want to destroy is completely off the grid?
  - I'm not killing anyone.
- - Tell me one thing, Elliot.
  - Are you a one or a zero?
- - That's the question you have to ask yourself.
  - Are you a yes or a no?
- - Are you going to act or not?
  - Yo... you've been staring at a computer screen way too long, homie.
- - Life's not that binary.
  - Isn't it?
- - Sure, there are grays... but when you come right down to it, at its core, beneath every choice, there's either a one or a zero.
  - You either do something or you don't.
- - You walk out that door, you've decided to do nothing, to say no, which means you do not come back.
  - You leave, you are no longer a part of this.
- - You become a zero.
  - If you stay, if you want to change the world, you become a yes.
- - You become a one.
  - So, I'll ask you again are you a one or a zero?
- - An innocent man is in prison because of what I did.
  - Come on, let's not kid ourselves!
- - This has nothing to do with Colby.
  - This isn't even about my revolution.
- - This is more than that for you.
  - This is about how those bastards slowly killed your father and how you wished he'd done something about it.
- - But he didn't. Because he was a zero, just like you're being right now.
  - fuck you.
- - Disappearing again?
  - I'm not killing anyone. Leave me out of this.
- - You don't get to disappear from this.
  - We can do it with or without you, but you're a part of it either way!
- - Yeah, even your stupid hoodie can't protect you, bitch!
  - This was a mistake.
- - I've gotta turn them in. Should I turn them in?
  - Will I get into trouble? shit, she's right.
- - I'm culpable now. No, we're culpable.
  - You're in this with me, so start thinking of solutions now.
- - Shayla?
  - Yo, Shayla.
- - Yo, bro.
  - Can I help you with something?
- - I, uh... just need to talk to Shayla.
  - Oh, your girl.
- - She in the tub.
  - Shayla.
- - Yo, she'll be out in a minute.
  - Can sit and wait if you want.
- - I think we should check on her, make sure she's all right.
  - You a funny dude. I like you.
- - Don't be rude.
  - Sit down and chill.
- - No, that's right.
  - You only do this.
- - Only nigga I know that take withdrawal meds while he using.
  - That's smart.
- - Probably even convinced yourself you ain't an addict.
  - Oh, shit.
- - Forgot to introduce myself. I'm Fernan...
  - Fernando Vera, Shayla's supplier.
- - One of the worst human beings I've ever hacked.
  - His password? eatadick6969.
- - Aside from the massive amounts of money he spends on p0rn and webcams, he does all his drug transactions through emails, IMs, Twitter.
  - The fact that the cops haven't caught him yet is beyond me.
- - If they had half a brain cell, they'd be able to crack his gang's simplistic code, if it can even be called that.
  - After only a couple of hours of timing his tweets with related news articles, I figured out that biscuit and clickety clearly referenced guns.
- - Food, sea shells or gas for bullets.
  - And the ultimate rock to sleep early.
- - I haven't made the direct connection to a hit yet, but the math of guns plus bullets usually adds up to one thing.
  - I've thought about turning him in, but he's Shayla's only supplier.
- - I take him down, I lose my drugs, and with everything going on right now, I can't have that.
  - You get that, though?
- - Anyway, bro, I ain't nothing to worry about.
  - Just making a drop for you.
- - What's your name, anyway?
  - Elliot.
- - What it mean?
  - What, you ain't never Googled it?
- - Man, you gotta do that.
  - The meaning of a person's name is important, bro.
- - Yo, she good! She good.
  - Trust me.
- - Took care of that shit myself.
  - You remind me of me when I was younger, depressed and sullen.
- - Matter of fact, tried to kill myself, a couple of times.
  - Never could get that shit right.
- - Biology wasn't my strong suit.
  - I hated myself, man. Still do.
- - Thought that shit was a weakness for a long time.
  - Then I realized that shit was my power.
- - People walk around, act like they know what hate means.
  - Nah, no one does, until you hate yourself.
- - I mean... truly hate yourself.
  - That's power.
- - You ain't scared of me, are you?
  - That's good.
- - Means I didn't waste my time making friends with you.
  - You don't really need these, do you?
- - Man of your courage can last through a little withdrawal.
  - Ya know, you the only reason why I met Shayla.
- - I'm the only nigga in town carrying everything, including your precious Suboxone.
  - So, in a weird way, I should be thanking you.
- - You brought her to me.
  - Your star orbiting with mine, gravitationally, brought me the love of my life, Elliot.
- - I mean, this, us?
  - Being here?
- - This has... beautiful meaning.
  - But make no mistake, that girl in there... is mine.
- - I don't know what I'd do without her.
  - Now, I don't know what kind of arrangement you had with her before, but now that we friends...
- - I trust you respect this boundary.
  - Feel me?
- - A dude earlier today gave me that same look.
  - Only thing I gotta say is, there's a smart time to be scared, bro...
- - And a stupid time.
  - Shayla?
- - The lock pick.
  - Every hacker's favorite sport.
- - The perfect system to crack, mostly because unlike virtual systems, when you break it, you can feel it.
  - You can see it. You can hear it.
- - Shayla.
  - Hey.
- - Shayla.
  - Wake up.
- - Mm.
  - What happened?
- - You okay?
  - Why was that asshole here?
- - Why am I in the tub?
  - I don't know, um... I told him I needed your pills.
- - He came over. We smoked a little.
  - You remember having s*x with him?
- - What? No.
  - But he definitely does.
- - Okay, let's go.
  - Get your purse, make sure...
- - Stop.
  - I'm not going anywhere, okay?
- - What do you mean?
  - Oh, he's just gonna get away with it?
- - You can't go back to him. Hey, I don't need the pills.
  - Just find someone else.
- - I can't.
  - He gives me a really good deal on the split.
- - I make good money.
  - There it is again, the invisible hand at work, controlling us, even if it pushes us past our threshold of pain.
- - It's not gonna stop.
  - What if he does it again?
- - Promise me you won't do anything?
  - I'm serious, Elliot.
- - There's nothing to be done here.
  - It's not like I have a choice.
- - Hey...
  - Would you mind sleeping here tonight?
- - Choices.
  - Maybe Mr. Robot's right.
- - That's what this is all about, the yesses and nos of life.
  - But do we decide them or do they decide us?
- - Fernando Vera. I get rid of him, I get rid of my drug dealer's supplier.
  - I get rid of the morphine.
- - And the pain I've been holding in comes rushing out.
  - Sure, I can try to find another dealer, but like Vera said, no one on the streets deals Suboxone.
- - I could go back to digitally counterfeiting scripts, but pharmas spend a lot of dough protecting their wares.
  - Most places only take paper scripts.
- - Continuously getting legit refills isn't realistic, and neither is being a junkie.
  - So I quit cold turkey or let Vera exist.
- - I know what you're thinking. The answer's too obvious.
  - Vera may have been groping Shayla before, but he's graduated to rape.
- - Just like Shayla, he's left me no choice.
  - He can't be allowed to exist anymore.
- - Perhaps we should start with how you're feeling.
  - Not good.
- - What's not good right now?
  - Everything.
- - Humor me with some specifics.
  - How do we know if we're in control?
- - That we're not just making the best of what comes at us, and that's it.
  - Trying to constantly pick between two options.
- - Like your two paintings in the waiting room.
  - Or... Coke and Pepsi.
- - McDonald's or Burger King?
  - Hyundai or Honda?
- - Hmm.
  - It's all part of the same blur, right?
- - Just out of focus enough.
  - It's the illusion of choice.
- - Half of us can't even pick our own... our cable, gas, electric.
  - The water we drink, our health insurance.
- - Even if we did, would it matter?
  - You know, if our only option is Blue Cross or Blue Shield, what the fuck is the difference?
- - In fact, aren't they... aren't they the same?
  - No, man... our choices are prepaid for us, long time ago.
- - I'm sorry you feel you have no control.
  - Thought I was doing something good.
- - I was a part of this... project.
  - Thought I was going to be a part of something special.
- - And now?
  - Now...
- - It turned out to be a mistake, like everything else.
  - What's the point, right?
- - Might as well, just... you do nothing.
  - Might as well do nothing.
- - You've brought up this issue before, this issue of not feeling like you're in control.
  - Do you remember?
- - When we spoke about your father.
  - You talked about how he chose to do nothing when he was battling his cancer.
- - You told him he could have fought the company that caused it.
  - He could have told people about it.
- - He could have sought better care than what he was getting.
  - Instead, he did nothing.
- - Maybe your father felt the same way as you do now.
  - After all, like you said, what's the point?
- - It's different.
  - What's different is you've found options, Elliot.
- - That's the power you have. That's the control you own.
  - You don't have to just take what life gives you.
- - Come on.
  - Tell me what is going on with you.
- - I cannot help you if you keep me in the dark.
  - Shut up!
- - Shut up!
  - You've got bags under your eyes.
- - You're yelling. You're jittery.
  - For the last month, I have seen you slip into old patterns, old behaviors.
- - What is going on?
  - He's still not answering.
- - Well, we'll just have to ask him tomorrow.
  - Every time I try to play it or rip it, it just freezes up my computer and spits it back out again.
- - He's not okay.
  - He was acting so out of it at work today.
- - Um...
  - Are you saying something, babe?
- - Something's wrong.
  - Should I go over there?
- - And just...
  - Check in on him?
- - Uh... come on.
  - That's ridiculous.
- - You know he's always been a weirdo, right?
  - I'm really worried about him.
- - My Arizona buddy Fred hit me up.
  - He wants to grab a drink.
- - Shouldn't take too long.
  - Okay.
- - Nice one, bro.
  - Nice.
- - Deep passions, longing... The two of them had never felt such a love, such closeness, such a connection.
  - Found a way to do it without...
- - Shh!
  - Sit down.
- - I know how to take out the backups without blowing up the pipeline.
  - You know, Elliot, I really feel like we resolved this thing between us. Didn't you walk away?
- - I did.
  - Didn't I say that if you walked away, you were no longer a part of this?
- - I have a real plan...
  - If you want me to let you back in, there's an understanding we have to come to, a debt you have to pay, because, remember, you walked away.
- - I thought you didn't believe in debts.
  - Not true. I believe in debts.
- - I believe in erasing them.
  - What do you want?
- - I want you to tell me about your father.
  - You're not gonna get into my head, man.
- - Your David Koresh shit isn't gonna work on me.
  - Tell me how he died.
- - Why, man? Something tells me you already looked that shit up anyway.
  - I wanna hear it from you.
- - So I do this... we go back to the arcade, discuss the plan with the rest of them?
  - I don't know what you want me to say.
- - We were close. Very close.
  - He was my best friend.
- - Worked at Evil Corp his whole life.
  - He was one of the best computer engineers they had.
- - And out of the blue, he got fired.
  - No one knew why.
- - Then one day he told me.
  - He had leukemia.
- - Made me swear to never tell anyone, especially my mom.
  - So I didn't.
- - A few months go by... he got sicker and sicker.
  - Finally, I got so worried... told my mom.
- - When he found out, he got pissed.
  - Started yelling.
- - I remember I tried to hug him, tell him I'm sorry, and... kept shoving me away and shoved me so hard I fell backwards out the window.
  - I fell, and I broke my arm.
- - Never spoke to me after that.
  - Couldn't even look at me.
- - Even the night he died.
  - We good?
- - I understand what it's like to lose a parent.
  - It's heartbreaking.
- - Did you ever think he was right?
  - About what?
- - Hurting you that day?
  - For what you did to him?
- - You ever think you deserved it?
  - I didn't do anything to him.
- - I was trying to help him.
  - For betraying his trust.
- - I was eight years ol...
  - You didn't commit to the sacred pact you'd formed.
