  - Alderson.
- - It appears it will grant us the clearance we need by the end of the year.
  - It's October now, so that's two more months we'll have to wait.
- - Just in time for the holidays.
  - What is it?
- - Mr.
  - Alderson is a good-for-nothing wretch that is not to be trusted.
- - Oh, Wang Shu, you needn't worry.
  - Once our project ships, he'll have served his purpose and then he can be terminated.
- - In the meantime, he needs to be kept on a short leash and trained not to bite his master.
  - Very well, then.
- - Send him a reminder of what's at stake, should there be any interference.

  - You want me to stand up?
- - Yeah.
  - How ya doin', Freddy?
- - Not too good?
  - That's okay.
- - I get it.
  - Jerking off to underage girls on live video chats is one thing.
- - When it's played back, though, kinda loses its magic.
  - Who is this?
- - Check your email.
  - You should have received a message from me.
- - Need you to open the email and click on the link.
  - You the one that sent me the package?
- - Listen, please don't do this.
  - Look, I-I can pay.
- - Open the email and click on the link, Freddy.
  - Okay, look, if if this is some sort of a ransomware thing or you're trying to get money out of me, listen You obviously don't know me, because if you did, you'd already know I don't give a shit about money.
- - Do what I'm telling you, or I'm sending the video to the FBI.
  - Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- - No.
  - Fred, I gotta go.
- - I'm just wrapping up in here.

  - Copy the .
- - pst file to the thumb drive.
  - Inbox?
- - I'm an attorney, pal.
  - That inbox is full of sensitive client information.
- - You hear me?
  - Hello?
- - I was just taking a moment to think about whether or not I give a fuck.
  - I don't.
- - Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way All right, so what are you gonna do with my emails once you do get 'em?
  - Once you're finished, leave all your personal effects in your office your phone, your Fitbit, your smartwatch, anything with an on-off switch, then bring the USB drive to Grand Central.
- - You know, this isn't just gonna destroy me.
  - It's gonna destroy the people that work for me, my firm, their families, everyone.

  - Not long ago, we were talking about an economic collapse on par with the Great Depression.
- - Especially hard to believe given the November jobs report that was released on Friday.
  - Over 400,000 jobs were added.
- - This really shows the resilience of E Corp and their CEO, Tyrell Wellick.
  - If it weren't for their data recovery and their Ecoin loan program, we wouldn't be enjoying the turnaround we're experiencing right now.
- - A quote from the chair of the Federal Reserve seems to echo public opinion Sometimes the good guys really do come out on top.
  - All right.
- - Hey.
  - Walk to the furthest kiosk.
- - Get in line.
  - Okay.
- - I'm, uh I'm here.
  - I'm in line.
- - Don't get freaked out.
  - You're being tailed.
- - What?
  - Why?
- - They want to know who you're meeting.
  - I'll take care of them.
- - Right now Okay.
  - I need you to stop looking around like you're a coked-up Henry Hill.
- - Well, I-I-I actually did some.
  - What?
- - Yeah, some blow, you know.
  - Uh, some of the girls had some at the party, and I you know, the Christmas party.
- - A little or a lot?
  - What?
- - How much did you do, a little or a lot?
  - shit, man, I don't know.
- - Right now, it seems like a fucking lot, okay?
  - Take a breath, Freddy.
- - We're gonna get through this.
  - Wait a second.
- - Where are you, anyway?
  - As far as you're concerned, I'm everywhere.
- - What does that even mean?
  - It means I own the entire station.
- - Buy a ticket home.
  - No, don't want these guys to know where I live.
- - Trust me, Freddy, they already know.
  - All right, uh, I'd like a first train to Brewster, please.
- - Okay, I got it.
  - All right, now you're gonna head to the train, but we're gonna take the long way.
- - Want you to walk past the clock and go towards the Hudson News.
  - Take out all your cash.
- - Give it to the guy in the Santa hat.
  - Why?
- - We gotta buy time.
  - Fold it into a ball, make a fist, toss it in the case.
- - Don't stop.
  - Keep going.
- - Make a right and head to the tracks.
  - Hey, hey, hey.
- - Hey, hey, that's my money.
  - Track 19, last car on the right.
- - So you have been following me, haven't you?
  - No, I've been waiting For you on the train.
- - Who the fuck are you?
  - Thought I answered that already.
- - Don't think you need the phone anymore.
  - Sit down and give me the drive.
- - Yeah, first you're gonna give me all the copies of that video you have.
  - You gonna shoot me in front of all these people?
- - Put the gun away, Freddy, and sit down.
  - I'm serious.
- - I'm not afraid to use this if I have to.
  - And then that video will not only be automatically sent to the FBI but to your wife and kids.
- - Is that something you're afraid of?
  - Sit down.
- - Give me the drive.
  - So we're square, right?
- - You gonna erase that video?
  - I mean, it goes without saying.
- - I can't have anyone seeing that.
  - Look, I'll tell you what you keep that drive.
- - That'll show you how much I trust you, huh?
  - You understand me, man?
- - I'm trusting that your word is good?
  - I'm gonna head on back to the office.
- - Sit down.
  - We're not done.
- - Do you know who those guys were, the ones who were following me?
  - Dark Army.
- - Jesus Christ.
  - What the fuck were those guys doing following me?
- - They want to know who you're giving these files to.
  - Why?
- - Because they're protecting one of your clients.
  - What client?
- - Whiterose.
  - What the fuck are you talking about, man?
- - Who's that?
  - You know her as Zhi Zhang, the Chinese minister of state security.
- - He and his partners have been using shell corporations to move money around, and your name keeps popping up on all their company filings.
  - Oh, shit.
- - That's what this is about?
  - I'm a dead man.
- - I need to know how you've been helping them funnel money.
  - Oh, no, no, no, no, you don't want to fuck with these guys.
- - If half the shit that I've seen is real, then these guys are the official fucking bogeymen.
  - And I'm not talking conspiracy bullshit either, man.
- - I mean, these guys are pure evil.
  - I'm kind of ahead of you on that point.
- - Cyprus National Bank.
  - That's it.
- - That's their bank.
  - Tell me what you know about it.
- - I don't know shit, man, okay?
  - The reason they even hire peons like me is 'cause I'm willing to look the other way and push the right papers for 'em, small stuff, incorporation documents.
- - Look at me.
  - I'm a dumb shit.
- - You think they're gonna tell me anything?
  - I may have a contact in the city.
- - Who?
  - Stop fucking around, man.
- - We don't have a lot of time.
  - Give me the name.
- - John Garcin.
  - Where can I find him?
- - Well, I don't have the address on me.
  - I-I gotta go back to my office.
- - I told you to leave all your electronics.
  - I did.
- - I don't I don't have anything on me.
  - Look, I have nothing.
- - Go straight to the 42nd Street exit and wait for my call.
  - Don't stop.
- - Don't turn around.
  - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you're leaving me?
- - If they see us together, we're both dead.
  - Go.
- - Meet me at the corner of 42nd and Vanderbilt.
  - Okay.
- - Then what?
  - Still need Garcin's address.
- - Oh, no, you gotta be fucking crazy.
  - I'm not going back to my office.
- - Those guys are gonna be looking for me there.
  - Let me worry about that.
- - Listen, I want your word that if I give you what you want, you're gonna destroy that video.
  - You are in no position to negotiate right now.
- - Just fucking move.
  - Then I want your word!
- - If we don't get out of here, I'm not gonna be the one you need to worry about, you understand?
  - I am your only way out of this.
- - And just how the fuck are you gonna protect me against the Dark Army, huh?
  - Those guys just saw me running away from them.
- - They know that I'm up to something.
  - Oh, you can't protect me, can you?
- - Freddy?
  - Jesus Christ.
- - You don't give a shit what happens to me.
  - Freddy, we don't have time for this.
- - You need to snap out of it.
  - They are still coming for you, man.
- - You need to make it to this fucking corner right now.
  - Right now, Freddy.
- - Freddy, you need to keep moving.
  - Hello?
- - Just don't send that video to my kids.
  - Freddy!
- - Freddy?
  - Excuse me.
- - Excuse me.
  - We need room here.
- - We need room.
  - Hey, listen Taking pictures right now, lady?
- - What are you gonna do with them?
  - Come on.
- - Put it down.
  - Back up.
- - Jesus Christ.
  - Today's gonna be another busy one because of the cyber bombings memorial brunch.
- - The board of directors would like you to do some PR interviews today before you head upstairs.
  - Our media consultant is going to debrief you with some talking points back in the greenroom before we put you into hair and makeup.
- - You have about five minutes before your meeting with Mr.
  - Milligan and his team.
- - Thank you, Elizabeth.
  - Oh, that's not all.
- - After that, you have a meeting with the board.
  - It's more of a meet and greet, then straight into a meeting with the Ecoin engineering team to discuss the new rollout.
- - And tonight the board would like Can we just push any of this until tomorrow?
  - No, I'm afraid tomorrow's already full as well.
- - Can you just give me a minute?
  - Certainly, sir.
- - Congratulations.
  - I've been meaning to tell you that for a while now, but I wanted to give you your space.
- - Most of us here consider you a hero for what you did.
  - Mom?
- - Dom?
  - You up yet, hon?
- - I'm heading out to go mall walking with Janice, you know, that lovely girl I met at church a few weeks ago?
  - I want you to meet her.
- - I think you two would really hit it off.
  - Seriously, Dom?
- - It's almost noon.
  - You're still in your PJs.
- - What gives?
  - You all right?
- - What's he doing here?
  - I told you last week I was renovating the master bathroom.
- - What's the big deal?
  - What's the matter with you?
- - I thought we agreed I would vet everyone you hired.
  - Oh.
- - Hon, I thought you were kidding like you do.
  - Listen, I'm glad you're up.
- - I want you to put a load in so you have something to wear to the bake sale later.
  - Janice is coming over after for some macaroni and gravy.
- - You're just gonna leave this guy here alone?
  - He's not alone.
- - You're here.
  - This John Garcin practically posts every shit he takes.
- - It's gonna take forever to go through his social media.
  - I know we have our issues, but it's these people that are the real psychos.
- - I mean, how proud of your life can you be?
  - We have his address.
- - We should just go.
  - We'll get the info we need there.
- - It's too early for that.
  - We don't know enough.
- - He's their liaison at Cyprus National Bank.
  - He's gotta have something.
- - Be that as it may, we can't just knock on this guy's door and pretty please ask him for his access, so we put our heads down, do the research, find a way to break him, same as always.
  - Took us two weeks with Freddy.
- - We can't wait that long anymore.
  - We're running out of time.
- - By next week, Whiterose will ship her project.
  - We'll be dead.
- - I'm not gonna argue that with you.
  - Freddy could have saved us a lot of time if his brains weren't splattered all over 42nd Street right now.
- - He had it coming.
  - They all do.
- - Don't do this for the wrong reasons.
  - You're angry, and I get it.
- - But your anger is keeping you from seeing the bigger picture of why we started this thing.
  - You told me once you don't take down a conglomerate by shooting them in the heart, 'cause they don't have hearts.
- - You were wrong.
  - We found their heart.
- - We rob it she finally goes down.
  - What am I not seeing?
- - This used to be about saving the world.
  - You're making it too personal.
- - You're making this about what they did to Angela.
  - You're letting your feelings cloud your judgment.
- - My feelings?
  - See what's going on out there?
- - People are already forgetting about Five/Nine, the cyber bombings.
  - They're buying their Ecoin discounted stocking stuffers and Christmas hams, and they're gonna forget.
- - And I don't blame them.
  - They're exhausted.
- - I'm exhausted.
  - But we let this go, it'll be back to business as usual for Whiterose and her friends.
- - The more she gets away with this, the worse this gets.
  - So fuck my feelings.
- - I'm done with the therapy sessions.
  - This is all I'm focused on.
- - It's Darlene.
  - She says it's about Angela.
- - Oh, my God, thanks for calling me back.
  - Um, I think I figured it out.
- - Okay, I am I am really onto something.
  - Just wait until you hear this.
- - It's kind of a breakthrough.
  - Where's Flipper?
- - Uh, the landlord took her for the week.
  - Why?
- - What are you too busy with?
  - What's going on, Darlene?
- - What are you doing here?
  - I think I saw Angela.
- - We talked about this already.
  - Angela's gone.
- - Are you on something right now?
  - Don't make this about that, okay?
- - Just listen to me.
  - Okay, I need you to hear this.
- - I'm listening.
  - Okay, um, I was I was walking by one of those shelters, and I think I saw her.
- - Okay, I-I-I-I tried to catch up with her, but it was it was crowded and I lost her, but okay, but this is proof, right?
  - This is proof.
- - Maybe this is why they never found her body.
  - Maybe she's still alive.
- - That's not possible.
  - No, I am telling you I saw her.
- - She was on the street, same red cart, same bathrobe, exactly the way we saw her in that security footage before she got into that van.
  - Darlene.
- - Maybe she escaped.
  - I swear I saw her.
- - Maybe if you would just help me, we could find her together; we just need to canvass all of the homeless shelters.
  - This has to stop.
- - Elliot, we can't give up on her, okay?
  - We can't.
- - You did a little too much coke and you saw something that wasn't there.
  - I will show you where I saw her.
- - Just come with me.
  - Look at you, man.
- - You are so fucked up right now.
  - fuck you.
- - This is exactly what you do when shit like this happens.
  - You shut down.
- - Angela's dead.
  - Do you understand?
- - She's fucking dead.
  - And it's not our fault.
- - We tried to help her, remember?
  - She did this to herself.
- - You have to stop feeling guilty.
  - I'm not the one that feels guilty.
- - Why didn't you just show her the photo Whiterose sent to us?
  - You mean the one with Angela's brains blown out.
- - Yeah, no, I don't think so.
  - At least it would have put her out of her misery.
- - It'd break her heart.
  - We need to get back to work.
- - John Garcin should be our only focus.
  - I know we don't usually do this, but I have to fill you in if he won't.
- - That's why you're back, isn't it, to help?
  - You gotta be noticing it, then, too, that he's not talking to you.
- - He doesn't talk to me that much either, not since Angela died.
  - Darlene's right.
- - He's shutting down, compartmentalizing the pain, living in the distraction, just like the holidays the fake Santas, the plastic trees, the annoying Christmas carols O come, all ye faithful One big song-and-dance production to sell ourselves the theater that everything's jolly, at least for a moment.
  - But when it's all over, Santa's gone back to his shitty day job.
- - The trees get disassembled and thrown in a closet.
  - The music's faded away.
- - What then?
  - That's why you can't go anywhere.
- - I know he's keeping you away, but I'll let you in.
  - Don't think I'm doing it for you, though.
- - Let's be clear.
  - I still don't give a shit about you, but he does.
- - This does not feel right to me.
  - E Corp owns the building.
- - They own half of Manhattan.
  - We stick to the plan.
- - And right now, Elliot needs you more than he lets on, because when that cold, brutal reality closes in on us, we're gonna need a friend, and that's still what you are, right?
  - Um, a delivery for John Garcin in apartment 7C.
- - Seventh floor to the right of the elevator.
  - Thank you.
- - This goes sideways, We don't have enough information to break this guy.
  - We're just gonna own his Wi-Fi.
- - That'll grab us whatever we need without him knowing.
  - Is it just me, or is this the quietest building in all of Manhattan?
- - Hello!
  - Anybody home?
- - Let's check things out before he comes back.
  - That wasn't the plan.
- - We're only supposed to own his Wi-Fi.
  - Are you kidding?
- - He's not here.
  - We just got lucky.
- - Search everything.
  - Something's not right.
- - No shit.
  - Ah, fuck.
- - Did you lock the door?
  - No.
- - Signal's dead in here.
  - They're jamming it.
- - shit.
  - Phone's dead.
- - It's almost as if There is no John Garcin.
  - Freddy set us up.
- - It must have been a distress signal they gave Freddy.
  - Place is a honeypot.
- - Here's a little song I wrote You might want to sing it note for note Don't worry Be happy In every life, we have some trouble But when you worry, you make it double Don't worry Be happy Don't worry, be happy, now Ooh-ooh-ooh
  - No!
- - Let me go!
  - Stop!
- - Let me go!
  - Wait!
- - Wait!
  - Don't worry, be happy, now
- - So Father DiMarco spills his potato salad all over her, which I actually think he did on purpose because Sister Merkin has, you know, those big tatas underneath all that black and white.
  - Ma, come on.
- - Oh, get over it.
  - She's a hottie.
- - I've seen you check her out once or twice.
  - Janice, right, are you with me?
- - Sister Merkin is a ten, am I right?
  - Uh, s-she's quite attractive, yes.
- - See, Janice agrees.
  - Oh

  - I gotta get to bed.
- - I'm seeing Dr.
  - Passante in the morning for that thing on my neck.
- - Dom, hon?
  - Why don't you help Janice carry out the leftovers?
- - It's just some macaroni.
  - Dominique, don't embarrass me.
- - Go on and help.
  - Oh.
- - Uh, my apologies.
  - I forget how frightened people can be of them the first time.
- - I'm a taxidermist.
  - Uh, I wasn't frightened, just a little unexpected is all.
- - Taxidermy, huh?
  - Guess you were into stuffed animals as a kid?
- - Not particularly, no.
  - Well, um, it was nice meeting you, Janice.
- - And, uh, I'm sorry about all this.
  - All what?
- - I think my mom was trying to, you know set us up.
  - Oh, my, I had no Oh!
- - I
  - Oh, this is this is terribly awkward.
- - Uh, I-I-I-I think she might have gotten the wrong idea.
  - It's all good.
- - I'm on a self-imposed time-out anyway.
  - Okay.
- - My ma, she's just trying to cheer me up.
  - She thought this would help.
- - Yeah, she said you'd been through kind of a rough patch.
  - Bet she did.
- - Um It's not a big deal.
  - It's just a promotion at work has been a lot of stress is all.
- - Yeah, she said you haven't been sleeping, and she told me about the drinking, mm.
  - Oh, I hope I'm not speaking out of school.
- - I-I-I just meant to say I've been there with work, you know.
  - Long hours can really burn you out, especially in my field.
- - But I'm here to talk, if you want.
  - Sometimes that can help.
- - Yeah.
  - Anyway, I should get to bed.
- - Good night, Janice.
  - Yeah, that's a good idea.
- - You need your rest.
  - After all, you have that interview about the Santiago case in the morning.
- - Excuse me?
  - You've put it off for weeks.
- - It's starting to look suspicious.
  - What did you say?
- - I was just explaining that unless you go to work tomorrow and finish cleaning up Santiago's mess, then I'm gonna be forced to do something very bad to your mother, like, really bad, you know?
  - Like, I'm probably gonna have to slit her from mouth to c**t.
- - You touch my mom, I will strangle you to death.
  - You understand me?
- - Oh, you can strangle me till the cows come home.
  - That's not gonna stop the rest of 'em.
- - Now, you get that rest we talked about.
  - You got a big day tomorrow.
- - Oh, and would you thank your mom for me for the macaroni?
  - Real life, yo.
- - I'm just saying, the skullduggery of scientists led us to this point in believing this bullshit.
  - What bullshit, exactly?
- - That the Earth is a sphere when it so clearly is flat.
  - See, you ain't even willing to question it.
- - That's how they get you.
  - If the Earth's flat, then how come no one's ever fallen off the side?
- - Easy answer Antarctica.
  - Whoever lives here has to be fucking mental.
- - Dar.
  - What's up?
- - I just got here.
  - Please tell me you have something stronger.
- - Hmm, stronger than what?
  - Anything I've already taken.
- - That's what's up.
  - I got you.
- - shit, girl, you didn't even let me tell you what it was.
  - Why the fuck is someone in Angela's bedroom?
- - Who's Angela?
  - Oh, Prada, YSL, ChloÃ©, ballet shoes, and a bunch of fish food with no fucking fish.
- - Smells like some American Psycho shit's going on here.
  - Get the fuck out of here, you fucking Mary Poppins whore!
- - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
  - The fuck did you give me?
- - Babe, you need to chill.
  - fuck you.
- - What?
  - Get out.
- - Get out.
  - Get the fuck out right now!
- - Everybody, out!
  - Out!
- - Get the fuck out!
  - Go!
- - Get the fuck out!
  - Get the fuck out!
- - Is she listening?
  - Of course she is.
- - She always is.
  - Was that her in the SUV outside?
- - You tell her if she goes through with this, my shipping hack goes public.
  - She won't be able to move shit.
- - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
  - Hold on a second.
- - Listen to me.
  - The people you work for, they're terrorists.
- - They don't care about you or any of us.
  - I know you don't want to do this.
- - You're just getting paid to.
  - Please, I can't leave like this.
- - I've hurt so many people.
  - I have to make this right.
- - Wait.
  - Wait.
- - No.
  - You tell her if I die, this won't be over.
- - I know all about Cyprus National Bank.
  - Her money's as good as gone.
- - Even if I die
  - She's gonna pay for what she's done.
- - Do you hear me?
  - You tell that piece of shit that my anger won't die with me and she can't hide from what's coming for her!
- - You hear me?
  - Do you hear me?
- - Say something.
  - Good-bye, friend.
- - He got too reckless.
  - Your job was to control him.
- - My job was to protect him.
  - Your job was to protect all of us.
- - What's gonna happen?
  - The inevitable.
- - We're all gonna go away.
  - I just didn't think it was gonna be like this.
- - Hmm.
  - Welcome back, Mr. Alderson.
