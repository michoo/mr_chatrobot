  - There's Freddy Lomax the cartoon character you call a lawyer who committed suicide?
- - The person he met with escaped after compromising Grand Central's surveillance system.
  - And?
- - Gaining access to Grand Central is no easy feat.
  - We've been waiting for Elliot Alderson's next move, and this could be it.

  - I have no doubt that he will accept.
- - You ever play Russian Roulette?
  - They say once you pull that trigger, it changes you and you can't go back to who you were before you heard that infamous click, the sound of cheating death.
- - We've been lucky so far, but I can't shake the feeling that there's a barrel pointed at us and we're running out of chances to get that empty chamber.
  - I'm not sure what's taking Vera so long to come at us with bullets fully loaded.
- - Every time I try to talk to Elliot about it, he puts up a wall, like he's flat-out throwing me a forbidden error, denying me the chance to even bring it up.
  - But Vera's gonna find us sooner or later, and I just hope we see him coming when he does.
- - Oh, shit.
  - Krista.
- - Uh, give me a second.
  - Sure.
- - I've tried calling you.
  - Elliot, I thought I made myself clear.
- - Yeah, I got your letter.
  - I I just wanted to talk to you.
- - You know that can't happen.
  - I explained that in the letter as politely as I could.
- - You don't understand.
  - I'm I'm doing better.
- - I'm finally talking to Mr.
  - Robot just like you always said I should.
- - We cannot have contact anymore.
  - Do you understand that?
- - I just want you to know that I'm finally making some real progress.
  - I don't feel safe around you!
- - Leave me alone.
  - Or I'll be forced to take legal action.
- - I wasn't asking you to treat me again.
  - I just wanted to say thank you for helping me.
- - You okay?
  - Yeah.
- - Olivia Cortez was Susan Jacobs's contact at Cyprus National Bank.
  - She's the Deus Group's only U. S.
- - account manager since they want to make their presence here as minimal as possible.
  - She's our way in.
- - I don't see any Cyprus National Bank accounts.
  - Yeah, these banks make their lackeys use on-prem work boxes that are closed loop and near impossible to exploit remotely.
- - We'll have to get physical access to her laptop.
  - Kinda makes sense.
- - What?
  - That you made this your HQ.
- - It's where it all started.
  - No better place to plan how it'll end.
- - It's just an abandoned office I knew had a 10-gig fiber link.
  - Please.
- - I know you have a soft spot for this nerd factory.
  - Where are you going?
- - Olivia's iCal says her ex-husband's got her kid tonight and she's got a date.
  - Should give me enough time to check out her place and get on her machine.
- - Whoa.
  - You think I'm your little research monkey?
- - We agreed I'd handle the bank contact and you'd deal with the SS7 license.
  - That was before I knew we needed physical access.
- - Now you're gonna stay here and get the cell service permissions.
  - No, thanks.
- - I'm gonna stick with the plan.
  - You can spend your Christmas Eve here watching rats fuck.
- - I'm gonna go out and do this B&amp;E.
  - Will you talk some sense into her?
- - Darlene this is not your run-of-the-mill break-in.
  - This is a Deus Group contact.
- - Yeah, I get it, dude.
  - It's dangerous.
- - Okay, you know this whole protective older brother act's gotten beyond lame.
  - I'm telling you, this is too Risky?
- - Perilous?
  - Treacherous?
- - Hazardous to my health?
  - What the fuck do you think you're doing?
- - You're not going.
  - You're hurting me.
- - I know.
  - Is this you, or It's me.
- - What's happening to you?
  - You wanted to work with me.
- - This is the way it is.
  - If there's a problem, don't be here when I get back.
- - And here I thought things were better after yesterday.
  - But as per usual, it's one step forward and four fucking leaps back.
- - Nothing's ever gonna change with you, is it?
  - No, it's not.
- - I should've never opened my door when you came back into town.
  - There's no word for it, you know?
- - There's orphan, widow, widower.
  - So what do you call someone who's lost everyone?
- - Mom, dad, sister, girlfriend, friends.
  - A survivor?
- - Or a walking time bomb?
  - Elliot thinks the more he restricts everyone's access, the less vulnerable he'll be.
- - But there's a trade-off that he's forgetting.
  - If you block everyone, then what's the point of being here?
- - Of doing all this?
  - Of existing?
- - I'm that's her personal, but check it anyway.
  - There's nothing on Cyprus National Bank, but I've learned more than I want to know about this Evan dude she's on a date with.
- - His name is Evan, for fuck's sake.
  - He's into snowboarding, social media influencing, and Reiki.
- - Classic Evan.
  - What'd you find?
- - That.
  - We got her credentials, but without her security fob, we don't have shit.
- - You check the closet.
  - I'll take the nightstand.
- - She'll have it on her.
  - It's bank protocol.
- - How do you know she doesn't get sloppy sometimes and leave it behind?
  - You read the same shit on her I did.
- - She's a single mom who spent three years in night school to get this job.
  - Someone like that isn't going to risk the best gig they've ever had by being sloppy.
- - So we install a listener on her machine, wait for her to log in.
  - It's the holidays.
- - She isn't logging in anytime soon.
  - And even if she did, we'd only got 60 seconds to swipe the code.
- - Okay.
  - We phish her, get her to log in, catch the RSA code then.
- - We're all good.
  - If she doesn't take the bait?
- - We don't have time to chance it.
  - Well, if you have any ideas, I'm all fucking ears.
- - Looks like he stood her up.
  - Okay, she's leaving.
- - Let's go back and regroup.
  - I found a bottle of oxy in her apartment.
- - So?
  - She's an addict who's supposedly gone straight.
- - Custody agreement says if she gets caught using again, she loses her kid.
  - So what do you want to do with that information, exactly?
- - You know how this works.
  - Hang on, kiddo.
- - What for?
  - Why don't you try a little small talk?
- - Keep her here for a while, grab the fob, and then punch in the code.
  - No.
- - There's no time for small talk.
  - Not when we already own her.
- - I'm sorry.
  - Excuse me?
- - You're gonna want to sit back down.
  - What are you talking about?
- - Cause I'm gonna buy you a drink.
  - I'm sorry, do I know you?
- - This is a waste of time we don't have.
  - I'm Elliot.
- - Now you know me.
  - I'm gonna take off, actually.
- - It's been a long day.
  - Okay.
- - I'll come clean.
  - I couldn't help but notice you were stood up.
- - Now, it's none of my business, but the guy's clearly a sack of shit to leave you alone on Christmas Eve, and if you'd let me, I'd like to apologize for those of us who have done you wrong by buying you a drink.
  - Another round?
- - Why not?
  - It's Christmas.
- - You're on, kiddo.
  - There you go, Juanito.
- - Tell your mama I packed it special for her.
  - Merry Xmas.
- - Tell me you brought tidings of joy about my dude Elliot.
  - Come on, bruh.
- - What was so important about this m*therfucker, anyway?
  - You know why we came back here, right?
- - Well, do you?
  - So you could be king of New York.
- - And in order for our kingdom to be built, I need a brilliant Architect.
  - I know.
- - Yeah, see?
  - You totally get it.
- - You just be selling yourself short.
  - Hey, listen here, bruh.
- - Look, I may not be no architect, but let me tell you something I'm loyal to the bone.
  - So let me just get my gun, put it to his head, and make him give you what the fuck you want.
- - How many times I gotta explain it?
  - I don't want Elliot to be my prisoner.
- - A visionary like him don't work like that.
  - I want him to be my partner!
- - Now, reflect and give me something I can use.
  - Come on, bruh.
- - This kid is aloof.
  - I may be able to catch him around his hood sometimes, but for the most part, he riding solo and giving up nothing.
- - What do you mean, for the most part?
  - Well, see?
- - You gotta be more detailed.
  - The devil is in that shit.
- - Well, look.
  - I
- - I did see him arguing with this lady, all right?
  - And she seemed pretty mad.
- - Mad how?
  - I don't know.
- - Mad.
  - Details, bro.
- - Be specific.
  - Was she crying?
- - Was was her nipples hard?
  - Did a vein pop out of her forehead?
- - Man, make the connection.
  - Tell me you at least took some fucking pics.
- - Really, man?
  - Of of course.
- - I got you.
  - Look.
- - Right there.
  - You see?
- - She's pissed.
  - So what?
- - Look bro, we're wasting our time with this.
  - I mean, we took the risk to get back here.
- - I mean, shit, we might as well put it to good use, fam.
  - Hey, kid.
- - Tell me what you see.
  - He feels bad because she's yelling, like when my mama's mean to me.
- - It makes me sad, like him.
  - How come this fuckin' little kid sees it and you don't?
- - This ain't about her.
  - Her anger legit.
- - No doubt, the shit you need to see is on him.
  - She hurt him.
- - Not no superficial pain, neither, we talking stab-in-your-heart kind.
  - She our girl.
- - She knows something I gotta know.
  - Sorry, bruh.
- - I guess I just need someone a little more detail-oriented.
  - So, uh, we already know why I'm here on Christmas Eve.
- - What's your sob story?
  - I don't know.
- - I I guess I don't have anywhere else to be.
  - No family?
- - My sister and I got into a big fight.
  - My mom died yesterday.
- - Oh, my God.
  - I'm so sorry.
- - For what?
  - For your you know, that thing about your mom dying?
- - Oh.
  - No.
- - We weren't that close.
  - Yeah, I kind of have the same deal with my dad.
- - I mean, we used to be pretty tight.
  - But not as close as my mom and me.
- - She was amazing.
  - She died too.
- - Back in Colombia.
  - I took it really hard.
- - I kind of put my dad through a lot of shit after that, and But we don't have to get into it.
  - Okay.
- - I'm addicted to m morphine.
  - Well, do you have some on you?
- - Uh I'm kidding.
  - Oh, my God.
- - Your face.
  - And now I feel bad.
- - No, that's okay.
  - I I deserved that.
- - So how long you been clean?
  - Almost nine months now.
- - Well, not if you count the heroin I did two days ago.
  - But I didn't really want it.
- - Well, did someone hold you down and force you to do it?
  - Yeah.
- - But I'm I'm clean now.
  - Are you crazy or something?
- - I guess so.
  - I'm not like most people.
- - I'm starting to pick up on that.
  - Olivia?
- - Evan, from, uh, OkCupid.
  - I'm sorry.
- - I have no idea who you are.
  - Isn't this you?
- - Nope.
  - This is totally you.
- - Look, it's getting late.
  - Well, it was nice to meet you, Elliot.
- - Well, you did better than I thought you would.
  - Yeah, I don't see the light I saw in you before And no, I don't And no, I don't And I don't care anymore Baby, believe me And you had every chance You destroy everything that you know Uncontrollable If you don't need me Just let me go You hate, you bite, you lose
- - Uh, just looking for some aspirin.
  - Oh, shit.
- - Here, let me help.
  - I've got all this crap.
- - It's not what you think.
  - Look, earlier when I told you that I put my dad through some shit when my mom died It was because of this.
- - I was really fucked up after my mom got killed.
  - Murdered, actually.
- - I never say that to anyone.
  - It totally wrecked me and I couldn't pull myself out of it.
- - And then, one day, someone gave me a pill, and
  - That was that.
- - It was like, my way out of that black hole.
  - But it led me right into another one.
- - One that hurt a lot less.
  - For for a while, anyway.
- - A reminder.
  - If I hate myself enough to start using again, I might as well kill myself.
- - So there it is.
  - The moment I tell you I'm crazy too.
- - I get it.
  - I know what it's like.
- - What?
  - Hating yourself.
- - I almost did it once.
  - What stopped you?
- - I promised a kid I'd take him to go see The Martian.
  - Yeah, of course.
- - You know, you can't scare me.
  - Well, there's a lot more crazy where that came from.
- - But I think that's enough for tonight.
  - Who knew Olivia would be the one to override Elliot's attempts to deny access?
- - Now he's gotten the message letting people in doesn't have to hurt.
  - Why are you stopped when we've got to get to Allsafe?
- - That van's been following us since we got off the subway.
  - Dark Army?
- - It's gotta be.
  - You think Olivia ratted us out?
- - No.
  - We got out of there clean.
- - This is a trap.
  - We've been off the radar for months.
- - All of a sudden, Whiterose takes interest in us again?
  - What if she's trying to find out about our plan?
- - Then let's show her we don't have one.
  - Just go home and act normal.
- - Here's our turn again.
  - Loading a bullet into a chamber spinning the cylinder and then the trigger.
- - Question is, are we getting that friendly click?
  - Or is it the end of the game?
- - That's it.
  - We cannot go in there.
- - Let's make a run for it.
  - Run where?
- - They're outside too.
  - What do we do?
- - Exactly what we'd do if we had nothing to hide.
  - Like I said before, letting people in doesn't have to hurt but it can.
- - Especially if they're the type of person that doesn't ask, that just forces their way in whether you want them to or not.
  - Elliot.
- - I've come with the news we've been waiting for.
  - They want to make me CEO of E Corp.
- - Are you hearing me?
  - The offer came directly from Whiterose.
- - What's this what are you doing?
  - This is exactly what we've been waiting for.
- - We're on the inside.
  - It's time to take them down!
