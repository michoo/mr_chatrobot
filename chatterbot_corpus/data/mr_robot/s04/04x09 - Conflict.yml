  - You want to help me?
- - Go find Elliot, and take them down.
  - I own everything.
- - Every bribe, blackmail, extortion everything will go public.
  - Mr. Alderson, he's too much of a liability.
- - If we kill him, his shipping hack dies with him.
  - It's time he learns we're on the same side.
- - See?
  - They all came back.
- - Everyone's okay again.
  - Angela, whatever Whiterose told you is a lie.
- - I know it's possible.
  - I've seen it.
- - I don't know if I can go through with the hack anymore.
  - Look at me.
- - I am not the one Darlene talked to.
  - You shouldn't be sitting there.
- - That's not your seat.
  - Why?
- - They're not ready yet, so we need to wait.
  - How is he?
- - It's not going to happen today.
  - There's no point in waiting here now.
- - We aren't going anywhere.
  - You know where he is.
- - You need to bring him here.
  - It's not that simple.
- - We're gonna have to help him through this.
  - Mom.
- - Maybe we should just tell him now About everything.
  - Then Elliot will be okay.
- - Right?
  - I'm telling you.
- - He's not ready.
  - When will he be ready?
- - You've let this go on far too long.
  - It's a little more complicated than that.
- - I didn't know everything that was happening.
  - That's a lie.
- - You've been part of these shenanigans from the beginning.
  - You encourage it.
- - Okay, okay.
  - Just stop.
- - Yes, I'll admit it.
  - I did.
- - I never thought he'd take things this far.
  - There's nothing I can do now.
- - Just talk to him.
  - We have to finish his mission.
- - Once the hack is done, maybe then I can get through to him.
  - And how are you gonna do that?
- - I'm gonna show him what he did.
  - And if it doesn't work?
- - We can't go on like this.
  - And that poor boy.
- - We may lose him forever.
  - For God's sake, he hasn't woken up since That's not true.
- - Darlene.
  - She said they talked two months ago.
- - He woke up for her Which means she might be the one who could help us.
  - Great.
- - You decided to show.
  - I know.
- - You weren't expecting me.
  - But I'm here for Elliot, same as you.
- - What can you expect after what happened?
  - Life throws you an error code like that, you don't have the luxury of a fucking pop-up explanation.
- - So what are you supposed to do?
  - Move on without answers, or stay down and drive yourself crazy with questions?
- - That's where Elliot is mired in conflict.
  - And that's why I'm here.
- - How we doing?
  - Got line of sight on the IMSI catcher to the front door.
- - Deus members should be arriving soon.
  - Where the fuck have you been?
- - Got held up.
  - What kind of answer is that?
- - You had me worried.
  - I told you the Dark Army is looking for you.
- - The day didn't go exactly as planned.
  - Cut me some slack, okay?
- - Things went a little sideways.
  - Oh.
- - Really?
  - Is that so?
- - Things went a little sideways for you, huh?
  - You want to hear about the fucking night I've had?
- - This isn't a pissing contest, sweetheart.
  - Let's just get back to work.
- - What the fuck are you doing?
  - Why are you here?
- - Where is he?
  - You don't want him here right now.
- - Why the fuck not?
  - He just can't.
- - Not now.
  - What happened to him?
- - He'll be fine.
  - He just needs some time.
- - I don't trust you.
  - I don't need you to trust me.
- - I just need you to help me pull this off.
  - Tell me what's going on, or I'm walking.
- - I can't.
  - He needs to be the one to tell you when he's ready.
- - What the fuck are you doing here?
  - Do you realize how risky this is?
- - What if someone saw you?
  - She's with me.
- - Out with it.
  - Why are you here?
- - You're supposed to be across the street with your Deus pals.
  - There's one last thing I need from you.
- - Well, it's a little late in the game to be making demands.
  - It's it's not a demand.
- - It's a favor.
  - Given the danger you've put us all in just by being here, I hope it's worth it.
- - It is.
  - What's this?
- - I want you to destroy Whiterose's machine.
  - Everything you need to know about her project, it's on here.
- - Promise me.
  - After tonight, she'll be ruined.
- - Why is this important to you?
  - Because it was important to Angela.
- - It's what she wanted.
  - Okay.
- - I promise.
  - Remember, you gotta keep everyone there until we grab their phone numbers.
- - Don't let anyone leave, especially Whiterose.
  - What was that about?
- - Hey.
  - What the hell does Price know about Angela?
- - What is going on?
  - I'll fill you in, but right now, we gotta get started.
- - We're already behind.
  - In order to rob the Deus Group blind, we need to get access to transfer funds from Cyprus National Bank.
- - To do that, we need every Deus asshole's phone number.
  - Why?
- - Because Darlene can then match each of those phone numbers to its corresponding Cyprus National Bank account number and initiate a transfer.
  - Once she initiates the transfer, it'll trigger a security 2FA code that'll be texted to every Deus dickhead's phone.
- - Then Darlene will run a script to automatically grab those 2FA codes, and transfer all their money before they have time to stop it.
  - So, yeah, I'm worried.
- - For what, though, I'm not sure.
  - But whatever it is It's coming.
- - I can't believe Angela never told me Price was her father.
  - Maybe she didn't know.
- - I miss her.
  - Darlene, I No, I don't want to talk about it.
- - I just I just wanted to say that.
  - Okay.
- - Something's not right.
  - No one's gone in or out of that building other than Price.
- - Wait, you think they're onto us?
  - I don't know.
- - I see I'm the first to arrive.
  - Technically, I was first.
- - You want to tell me what's going on?
  - I thought we'd start with a drink.
- - I'm an old man, Zhang.
  - I gave up on foreplay long ago.
- - Let's just skip ahead to the part where you try to fuck me.
  - If they are onto us, if the Deus Group doesn't show, everything's we've been working on will be a big fucking fail.
- - If Elliot were here, what would he do?
  - He'd look for abnormalities, incompatibilities, anything that isn't adding up, any conflicts.
- - What are you doing?
  - Looking.
- - For?
  - I don't know yet.
- - Elliot saved an image of Tyrell's phone, swiped all his credentials.
  - If Whiterose thought something was up, she would've told the other members, including the guy she was having the meeting for.
- - All you had to do was nothing, just sit idly by and wait for the new year to arrive, but you couldn't leave well enough alone.
  - I wanted to let you live into retirement I planned on it as a gift of sorts.
- - I guess you can say I always get swept up when it comes to the holidays.
  - But then you had to be naughty.
- - Come on, Zhang.
  - You know I've never been the nice type.
- - Let me drive.
  - Maybe his calendar.
- - After your abrupt resignation and Mr. Alderson's curious disappearance, it wasn't hard to figure out that you two were working together.
  - Tell me Mr. Alderson's plan, and these gentlemen will take you home and inject you with maitotoxin.
- - You will die in your sleep.
  - The papers will say you passed from heart failure.
- - Sad, but painless.
  - Or, we could go the other way.
- - You're well aware of our methods.
  - So you canceled the Deus Group meeting based on this half-cocked conspiracy theory of yours.
- - This last-minute change will not sit well with the others.
  - Downtown near Wall Street.
- - Hey, are you hearing this?
  - Let's move.
- - We gotta go.
  - Do-or-die time.
- - They're probably already inside, which means we'll have to find a way in to get a line of sight.
  - Price didn't know about the venue change.
- - So what?
  - Why didn't they tell him?
- - I don't know.
  - He's persona non grata on his way out.
- - Who gives a shit?
  - Why the heavy security detail?
- - Price is one guy.
  - If they wanted to get rid of him, they don't need a team of Dark Army soldiers to do it.
- - They're not there to kill Price.
  - They're there to protect someone.
- - The meeting is taking place as we speak.
  - I'm sure Mr. Wellick, the new CEO of E Corp, is impressing everyone with his smile.
- - Unfortunately, I'll be uncharacteristically late for the gathering, but I'm sure they'll understand.
  - Will they?
- - Hmm.
  - I'd expect mutiny when they realize that Tyrell Wellick, your guest of honor and the sole purpose for the meeting, will not be in attendance.
- - I'm gonna stay.
  - What?
- - You have the exploit to verify the phone numbers ready to go.
  - No, we can't split up.
- - What if something else goes wrong with the plan?
  - You know, it just occurred to me.
- - We've never gotten drunk together, have we?
  - I think this might be a good night to start.
- - What do you think?
  - The plan is pointless if we don't get Whiterose, too.
- - She's gotta be in there.
  - I have to stay.
- - That makes no sense.
  - We only have one IMSI capture.
- - We need to do this together.
  - We don't have a choice.
- - Now go.
  - Mr. Wellick is nowhere to be found.
- - We're still searching the tri-state area A waste of time.
  - Stop.
- - Tell them all to stop.
  - Is this part of your plan?
- - Mr. Wellick's mysterious disappearance?
  - What did you do to him?
- - Truthfully I have no idea where Wellick is.
  - He may be dead.
- - Mm.
  - No, no, no.
- - Now I think of it, he did mention something about wanting to travel the great southwest in a '65 El Camino convertible, wind in his hair He's beaten you!
  - You lost today.
- - Doesn't mean we can't fight back tomorrow, but right now, we have to leave and warn the Deus Group before this gets worse.
  - We are not going anywhere.
- - If you won't listen to reason, then I'm done.
  - Whoa.
- - It's bad management when your best employees either walk off the job, or blow their brains out.
  - fuck am I gonna get in there?
- - Perimeter is secure.
  - Make sure these doors stay locked the rest of the evening.
- - Goddamn.
  - Christmas Day?
- - This better be good.
  - Yeah, he's a dickwad, but a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States That runaround for tonight's location details Iraq's a proper mess.
- - Deus needs to get its giant dick out of that sand sooner than later.
  - Rousseff is fucked.
- - He did it to himself.
  - Or was that us?
- - How are you, my friend?
  - Just came off an 11-hour flight on Christmas Day.
- - Ah.
  - My wife is furious.
- - And my girlfriend?
  - She won't return my phone calls.
- - Whatever Zhang has planned better be good.
  - Couldn't agree more.
- - Evening, gentlemen.
  - Hors d'oeuvres?
- - Speaking of, where is our host?
  - Back inside.
- - This entrance is off limits tonight.
  - Go.
- - There's no fucking way.
  - Well?
- - Who is it?
  - Hello?
- - That sure as hell doesn't sound like Price.
  - Mr.
- - Alderson.
  - It's good to hear your voice.
- - I was hoping we could talk in person.
  - You once told me that we'd never see each other again.
- - What makes you want to see me now?
  - Call it a change of mind.
- - A realization.
  - Nah.
- - If I'm hearing your voice on the other end of this call, I'm good.
  - And what does that mean?
- - You'll know soon enough.
  - A proposal.
- - You stop whatever it is you're planning, and I give you information that will prove to be very valuable to you.
  - You think I'm gonna trust you?
- - Let me earn your trust by sharing first.
  - It is about your friend Angela.
- - What about her?
  - You see, Elliot You think Angela's dead, but she's not.
- - You sent me a picture of her dead body, you sick fucking fuck.
  - And you believe what most people believe?
- - Only what is right in front of you?
  - I expected more from you.
- - You think I'm gonna believe this bullshit?
  - You killed her.
- - Angela's dead.
  - No, Elliot.
- - Angela's alive.
  - And if you allow me, I can take you to her.
- - Would you like that, Elliot?
  - Would you like to see Angela again?
- - To hear her voice?
  - To hold her hand?
- - Elliot, are you there?
  - Yes.
- - I know you have regrets, Elliot, and pain.
  - I know there are things in your life you wish were different, just the same as Angela, and I can show you a way that you can make it all go away, just as I did for her.
- - You can reset everything and live in the world you deserve, a world without all the pain you're carrying, without your past, without your regrets.
  - Please, Elliot.
- - Let me show you the world that I showed your closest friend.
  - I saw what you did to her before you killed her.
- - That wasn't Angela.
  - You used her.
- - You turned her into someone else.
  - Then don't take my word for it.
- - Ask her yourself.
  - Elliot, we don't have to fight like this anymore.
- - Let's finally make peace with each other, as we were always meant to do.
  - Let go of the anger and the hatred you've built up towards me.
- - Understand I've only wished to help.
  - Here's the thing.
- - I don't need help right now.
  - You do.
- - Good evening, people of Earth.
  - We are fsociety.
- - We have risen from the ashes to bring you a Christmas miracle, a miracle that will finally reveal our true nemesis.
  - The secret club running the world is the Deus Group, a clandestine collection of the world's richest and most powerful people.
- - Deus Group, we know you, and we know what you do.
  - And tonight, the whole world will learn about you.
- - Most of you watching have never heard the name Deus Group.
  - That's because they've worked hard to keep it that way.
- - To begin to understand their reach, to see the evil crimes they're responsible for, click on the link below to download all their private files.
  - And if you'd like to meet the despicable individuals who have co-opted your lives for profit, come meet them now in person while they wine and dine at Cipriani.
- - I am sure they'd appreciate the visit.
  - Deus Group, you have been owned.
- - fsociety and the world will cheer as we watch your black hearts stop beating.
  - This is not a warning.
- - This is the beginning of the end.
  - We are fsociety.
- - Hey.
  - Did you see the video?
- - Yeah.
  - Hopefully, that'll do the trick to smoke these fuckers out.
- - Did you find Whiterose?
  - Yeah.
- - I talked to her.
  - You what?
- - Jesus Christ.
  - You were supposed to hack her phone, not call it.
- - It was only for a second.
  - But it was Price's phone, so we still need to get Whiterose's number.
- - Are you okay?
  - I don't know.
- - I don't know anymore.
  - Hey, Elliot?
- - I'm glad you're back.
  - I gotta go.
- - What happened?
  - There's a cell tower.
- - If I can see traffic on that tower No, I mean We can't get past her security and into the hotel.
  - We need her phone number.
- - Hey.
  - Are you gonna be okay?
- - Only way this works is if we hit their accounts at the same time.
  - If the other members get the 2FA codes first, they'll alert Whiterose.
- - Just keep them in your line of sight.
  - I'll let you know when I've got it.
- - Sergey, you have to trust me.
  - We will get through this.
- - Everything will be all right.
  - Oh, don't listen to that Mason.
- - The man is an absolute buffoon.
  - No, no, don't leave.
- - Don't go outside.
  - Tell everyone to remain, Sergey.
- - Sergey?
  - Hello?
- - Hello?
  - So that's it.
- - So that's your big move!
  - You think that I can't survive being doxxed?
- - I have no idea.
  - I'm as curious as you.
- - Hello?
  - Come on!
- - I can't do anything about it.
  - Look.
- - It's not working.
  - Obviously, it's not working.
- - shit.
  - Private event tonight.
- - You can't be here.
  - Everyone, back it up.
- - A short time ago, fsociety resurfaced with a new video, and while the contents of that video remain largely unconfirmed, it focuses entirely on an international investment firm, the Deus Group.
  - It's a collection of powerful men whom fsociety claims to be guilty of international crimes, and as you can see behind me, onlookers have gathered with hopes of catching a glimpse of any Deus Group members.
- - All this over a little pipsqueak in a hoodie.
  - Where are we at, kiddo?
- - I've got a bunch of numbers.
  - I just can't tell if any of them are hers.
- - Truth be told, I never liked Mr. Alderson his anxious demeanor, his juvenile anger.
  - But he does bring something to the table well, for me.
- - Mr. Alderson is the only person I believe actually able to hurt you Truly hurt you.
  - And clearly, you believe it, too.
- - Come on.
  - Why do we have to cut these things so goddamn close?
- - What are you doing?
  - Peaceful out here.
- - Cold winter air.
  - Are you really going to make me force you into the car?
- - You know, I almost let myself believe you When you said Angela was still alive.
  - I know what kind of conman you are, how you operate.
- - Even though I saw your men drag her dead body away, I still wanted to believe what you were saying.
  - When you spoke to Mr. Alderson, I felt the power of your promise.
- - And all I could think is, well maybe that's what my daughter thought when you came to her.
  - The desperation to have all her pain go away, to have her past rewritten and that's why it works, right?
- - The one thing every person has regret.
  - You weaponize that, and then you use that weapon against them to destroy them.
- - But here's the thing I've realized as of late.
  - With Angela didn't work.
- - Angela lives on in the lives of the people who love her.
  - And that love that love fuels their unwavering resolve to turn the tables to destroy you.
- - You just remember, Zhang.
  - You did all this to yourself.
- - You should take your own advice, Phillip.
  - Accept your truth.
- - It's over.
  - Yeah.
- - Yes.
  - I suppose it is.
- - It happened.
  - It actually happened.
- - What?
  - Something wrong, old sport?
- - What is this?
  - Well, if it's what I think it is, we're all broke.
- - No.
  - That's impossible.
- - Apparently not.
  - Where is it, Phillip?
- - Where is my fucking money?
  - Gone.
- - I warned you.
  - I told you long ago.
- - I'm a mercenary.
  - I'd rather see you lose than win myself.
- - That can't be.
  - Finally.
- - I found a way to take what's most important to you.
  - No, no.
- - Your project, your dream of another world it's as good as dead.
  - Think of it this way, Zhang.
- - You didn't lose the game.
  - You just ran out of time.
- - And like that Rome falls.
  - No more Deus Group.
- - No more top 1% of the top 1%.
  - No more controlling every piece of our lives.
- - No more playing God without permission.
  - We took them down.
- - All of them.
  - FBI.
- - Open the door.
  - We have a warrant.
- - Minister Zhang, we have a warrant.
  - FBI.
- - Open the door.
  - Minister Zhang, come out.
- - We have a warrant for your arrest.
  - Minister Zhang.
- - Minister Zhang, we're coming in.
  - Three, two, one, execute, execute, execute.
