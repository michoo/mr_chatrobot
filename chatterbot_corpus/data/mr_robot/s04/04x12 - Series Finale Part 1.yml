  - Anyway, I thought you had a presentation today, or was that yesterday?
- - How'd it go?
  - I'm not sure.
- - You've always been your own harshest critic.
  - I'm sure you did great.

  - This sounds like someone who loves their son.
- - Everything's changed.
  - Even Me.
- - What was that, honey?
  - You, what?
- - If their past has changed Has mine?
  - Does that mean The window.
- - What window?
  - Elliot?
- - What's gotten into you?
  - Where's my bedroom?
- - It was right here.
  - Are you all right?
- - My bedroom.
  - Where is it?
- - Where it's always been.
  - No.
- - This can't be true.
  - What can't be true?
- - When I was eight years old, do you remember me having an accident?
  - What accident?
- - When I broke my arm.
  - Honey, you've never broken your arm.
- - You've never broken a bone in your entire life.
  - Elliot I'm worried about you.
- - Why don't we sit down?
  - If I didn't jump, does that mean there was no reason to?
- - Mom Just tell me.
  - Did you ever hurt me?
- - Did Dad?
  - Elliot your father and I never, ever hurt you.
- - We love you more than anything.
  - Where's all this coming from?
- - Did something happen between you and Angela?
  - Is this about her parents?
- - I don't mean to overstep, but I know they've had their ups and downs, and if you two think you're gonna end up like Angela?
  - She's Alive?
- - It's totally normal to be nervous before your big day tomorrow.
  - My big day?
- - I know the stress of a wedding can be taxing for a couple Wedding?
  - I'm marrying Angela?
- - Mom?
  - Where is Angela right now?
- - Unless she decided to become a runaway bride, she must be back in her apartment in the city.
  - What do you think?
- - Do you buy any of this?
  - We started out wanting to change the world, but did it happen?
- - Is this the world I fought so hard for?
  - A world free of all the pain I went through?
- - Am I actually considering that this could be real?
  - No.
- - I won't let myself.
  - Not yet.
- - Not until I see Angela.
  - Then I'll know.
- - If I see her, will this world make more sense or less?
  - I don't know, but it's worth the risk.
- - Mr. Alderson.
  - Oh, scared, huh?
- - Well, you should be.
  - After all, as far as you're concerned, I am evil incarnate.
- - Phillip, stop giving him such a hard time.
  - Oh, come on, Em, he knows I'm only joshing him.
- - Besides, if I'm to be his father-in-law, he should be a little frightened of me.
  - Sweetie, come on in.
- - Come on.
  - We came up a few days early to help Angela out with a few last-minute adjustments, but when we got here, as usual, she's done everything herself, so we've got nothing to do.
- - Don't be fooled.
  - She's bitter about that, so tread carefully.
- - She is amazing that way, isn't she?
  - She always has been, I guess.
- - Oh, and wait until you see her in her dress.
  - Okay.
- - Well, yes.
  - Anyway, to to what do we owe the honor?
- - Was Angela expecting you?
  - No.
- - I, uh Just wanted to see her.
  - Wow, you two really can't go a minute without missing each other.
- - So sweet.
  - I remember that feeling, I think.
- - And that is usually my cue to make everyone a drink.
  - Uh, that won't be necessary.
- - I'm just trying to find Angela.
  - Oh, well, she's meeting us for lunch.
- - She is?
  - Yes.
- - We're trying that cute place on the corner.
  - You should come.
- - Phillip, I want Elliot to come along.
  - Only after we've had one of my whiskey sours, hmm?
- - Only one.
  - I don't wanna be late.
- - You know, Elliot, I am so happy to see the two of you finally tie the knot.
  - Watching you grow up, I always knew there was something very special between the two of you, but, frankly, I was worried she wouldn't see it.
- - Between us, she didn't always have the best taste in men.
  - Yeah, I know.
- - But this is the start of something new.
  - Are you excited?
- - Oh, shoot.
  - That was meant to be a surprise.
- - We borrowed all of these from your mother.
  - Angela wanted to give something to you, something that embodied your whole story together.
- - I think she did a wonderful job.
  - I just love These images, I've seen them before.
- - I've pictured this fantasy so many times.
  - This is what normal people do when they're happy, right?
- - Get married, start a family, surround themselves with people they love, with people that love them.
  - Trust me, Em, we got lucky.
- - He's good, this one.
  - True love prevails.
- - Ever since he retired, he has become quite the softy.
  - You know, I know I'm not supposed to say anything, but when your father came by and showed us that gift that you got for her she's gonna love it.
- - Oh, don't worry.
  - It's just between us.
- - I am a vault, and he cannot remember anything past the last five minutes.
  - Bottoms up!
- - Mm!
  - We should get going.
- - I don't wanna be late.
  - Mmm, it's good.
- - Oh, well, this is weird.
  - Elliot, it says that you're calling me.
- - No, don't don't don't fall for it, Em.
  - He's he's just doing a gag with the phone.
- - Am I right?
  - Oh, he's such a whiz with these gadgets.
- - What's the trick, huh?
  - What happens if you pick up?
- - What?
  - What happens if you answer?
- - Uh, here.
  - Let me do it.
- - N-no.
  - Let me let me do it.
- - Hello?
  - Emily?
- - You there?
  - Are you all right?
- - What happened, dear?
  - Look at what you did.
- - He's getting cold feet.
  - Well, how exactly am I responsible for that?
- - Because of your passive-aggressive jokes.
  - Whoa!
- - Oh, my God!
  - Okay, nobody panic.
- - It's just a little accident.
  - I've got it.
- - Ouch!
  - Ow.
- - That voice, that was mine.
  - How can that be possible?
- - I saw myself in those pictures.
  - That was me, wasn't it?
- - Or no, was it him?
  - So are there two of me?
- - I didn't think about that before, but that's possible, isn't it?
  - Everyone's different here Price, my dad, my mom Me.
- - But if this world isn't mine Then whose is it?
  - This guy is definitely not me.
- - And I am definitely not him.
  - I need to find out exactly who he is.
- - shit, the boot drive is encrypted.
  - Maybe he's more like me than I thought.
- - Based on this, he doesn't have crippling social anxiety or paranoia.
  - He looks like he's fun at parties, makes a good living, has lots of friends.
- - Everything in his life seems perfect.
  - But nobody is as perfect as they seem.
- - Come on, come on, come on.
  - I know I'll find something.
- - He can't be this happy.
  - No one is.
- - Haven't you been paying attention?
  - Everyone has a secret.
- - People are always hiding something their vulnerabilities, their fears, their shame.
  - I don't care how happy he looks.
- - Everyone has a monster.
  - The question is, what's his?
- - And there it is, a hidden partition, a drive full of files he doesn't want anyone to see.
  - These are images Of me My life.
- - How does he know about me?
  - Did he somehow hack my world?
- - Am I his monster?
  - Who are you?
- - I know this is fucked up.
  - What are you doing in my apartment?
- - And why do you look like me?
  - I think we should talk.
- - I'm calling the police.
  - I don't know who you are or what you want.
- - No, we can't involve the cops.
  - Stay where you are!
- - You're making a mistake.
  - Let's just take a seat.
- - I promise you, I can explain.
  - My name is Elliot Alderson.
- - I was born in Washington Township, New Jersey, September 17, 1986.
  - Same as you.
- - You could've looked all that up.
  - Look at me, man.
- - You really think I'm making this up?
  - Let's sit.
- - I'm good where I am.
  - Start talking.
- - Why do you have those sketches on your computer?
  - What sketches?
- - The hidden partition.
  - How did you get in there?
- - Doesn't matter.
  - I need you to tell me why you made those sketches.
- - Hey, you look exactly like Holy shit, how is this happening?
  - That's what I'm trying to figure out.
- - That's why we need to talk.
  - The files on your hidden partition What are they?
- - Sometimes when I get bored, I create people in my head Like him.
  - You know, someone with a more exciting life.
- - Like a superhero, except his power would be computers.
  - He'd a cybersecurity engineer by day, vigilante hacker by night.
- - Is that what you are?
  - What about the girl with the brown hair?
- - She's just sort of like his partner in crime.
  - And fsociety?
- - That's just a dumb name I came up with for a hacker group.
  - You know fuck society?
- - I figured that's what an anarchist hacker would come up with.
  - This is you, isn't it?
- - Why did you create this person?
  - I guess Sometimes I fantasize about being him.
- - So you want to be him?
  - No, not really.
- - Look at him.
  - He's angry.
- - He has no life.
  - He's alone.
- - He's not normal.
  - Oh, shit, man.
- - I'm sorry.
  - He shouldn't be.
- - He's right.
  - I'm not normal, and I never will be, no matter what world I'm in.
- - What is that?
  - Did you hear that?
- - What?
  - It sounded like you were talking to someone.
- - shit, he can hear us.
  - There it is again.
- - How are you doing that?
  - This was a mistake.
- - I don't belong here.
  - I was stupid to think that I did.
- - Wait.
  - Yo, man.
- - Are you okay?
  - Say something.
- - shit.
  - fuck.
- - I-I'm gonna go get some help.
  - Hello?
- - Oh, my God, Elliot.
  - What have you done?
- - Angela.
  - You are out of control.
- - The book.
  - What?
- - How were you able to find it?
  - You're so amazing.
- - This is the best gift anyone's ever given me.
  - Wait.
- - H-hold on a second.
  - Seriously, Elliot, I'm so lucky to be marrying someone like you.
- - Angela I'm not who you think I am.
  - Oh, you're not?
- - Then what'd you do with my best friend?
  - No, you don't understand.
- - I lost you.
  - What?
- - You never lost me.
  - I'm right here.
- - No, you don't get it.
  - No, I do get it.
- - Look, all you have to do is show up tomorrow, and then we'll finally be together for the rest of our lives.
  - Isn't that what you want too?
- - Of course, but Elliot, you always overthink everything.
  - You have to finally let yourself be happy.
- - That's all it takes.
  - It's just a choice that you have to make, a switch that you have to flick on.
- - Do you love me, Elliot?
  - What?
- - Do you love me?
  - Of course I love you.
- - I've always loved you.
  - Great, because I love you too.
- - So how about it, then?
  - You wanna start this new life with me or what?
- - More than anything.
  - Okay, then it's settled.
- - I'll see you tomorrow.
  - Help.
- - C-call someone.
  - Please.
- - Call an ambulance.
  - I can't move.
- - I need an ambulance.
  - But I'll lose her.
- - And I can't lose her again.
  - I'm sorry.
- - I think you should look away too.
  - Please, don't judge me.
- - This was inevitable.
  - You saw the earthquakes.
- - Both of us can't exist here in this world.
  - I had no other choice.
