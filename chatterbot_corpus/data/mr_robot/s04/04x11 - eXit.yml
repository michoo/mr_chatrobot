  - Sometimes I dream of saving the world.

- - It actually happened.
  - Are you sure you don't wanna come with us?
- - I can't.
  - I'm not done.
- - Where did the Dark Army go?
  - Your dream is as good as dead.

  - He isn't here.
- - He's dead.
  - There is only Whiterose.
- - Any advice for a road trip?
  - I've never been on one before.
- - Neither have I.
  - Recommend getting a bunch of Sour Patch Kids.
- - I've been through a lot, Darlene.
  - Thank you for never giving up on me.
- - I should get going.
  - We really pulled this off, didn't we?
- - fuck yeah, we did.
  - You know, you really started to grow on me ever since you stopped being such a dickhead.
- - Please tell me you're not really doing this.
  - From what I saw on that drive, I can make the software on Whiterose's machine completely unusable.
- - It will shut it down for good.
  - You mean the machine that's in a goddamn nuclear power plant?
- - We fuck up, this will cause a meltdown.
  - The right malware can corrupt the machine's entire system.
- - It won't even be able to start.
  - It would take decades for them to recode it.
- - No!
  - We're done, remember?
- - This is what we agreed to.
  - That's what last night was.
- - The last step.
  - We stick with the plan, we leave.
- - Besides, it would take you forever to write that malware anyway.
  - You've already written it, haven't you?
- - It wasn't that hard.
  - I used the same root kit we used to infect E Corp.
- - All I need to do is access a terminal on their network and plug it in.
  - This is not what we set out to do!
- - Whiterose isn't dead until her machine is!
  - Since when did her machine become our goal?
- - You don't get it, do you?
  - That's where all of this started!
- - You go down this path, it'll never end.
  - It'll always be something else.
- - Another symbol to destroy, more people to save.
  - This is an endless war.
- - At a certain point, we gotta move on.
  - Maybe you should go with them.
- - Please don't shut me out now.
  - I'm not shutting you out.
- - I want to do this one on my own.
  - I've been in this town so long That back in the city I've been taken for lost and gone And unknown for a long, long time Fell in love years ago With an innocent girl From a Spanish and Indian home Home of the heroes and villains Once at night Cotillion squared to fight And she was right in the rain of the bullets That eventually brought her down But she's still dancing In the night unafraid Of what a dude'll do In a town full of heroes and villains Heroes and villains Just see what you've done Heroes and villains Just see what you've done
- - Stand or fall I know there shall be peace in the valley And it's all an affair Of my life with the heroes and villains
  - My children were raised You know they suddenly rise They started slow long ago Head to toe healthy wealthy and wise I've been in this town so long So long to the city I'm fit with the stuff To ride in the rough And sunny down snuff I'm all right By the heroes and
- - Hey.
  - You're in the wrong place.
- - There's a world dying at my door I would die just to taste its blood some more I knew a world lying at my door For my lover's sins they buried my soul White widow
  - Seem unwell Look like hell But I don't care I've come a long way I've come a long way I've come a long way since Sunday Girl get running Yeah take a drive where your mind will cease to feel Stay alive if you feel you can stand still White widow she don't taste so sweet Her god is wrong her time has run White widow she is the sun and sleet My god is wrong my time has run Cause I know that my trial has gone Yet I know that my trial goes on and on
- - Usually I hand pick someone to do the introductions, but I felt that unnecessary since we've already met.
  - Please, have a seat.
- - This isn't gonna work on me.
  - What are you referring to?
- - The computer I used growing up.
  - A book my dad used to read.
- - You even got Qwerty here somehow.
  - It may have worked on Angela, but your brainwashing isn't gonna work on me.
- - This procedure has never been about brainwashing.
  - It is about helping you come to an understanding.
- - What's in the box?
  - I had a lot of pain growing up.
- - I wasn't born who I was meant to be, and it cost me a lot.
  - It cost me my one true love.
- - It cost me the life I was owed, the world I deserved.
  - You're not answering my question.
- - This world around us, I'm tired of it.
  - I'm tired of the pain it causes.
- - I'm tired of the disappointment it is, and all I've been trying to do, Elliot, all I ever wanted was to finally bring an end to that dysfunction and deliver us a better world.
  - You don't want to help the world.
- - You want to destroy it.
  - You want to destroy it because you hate people for what they've done to you, and you can't look past that to actually see the good in it.
- - Elliot, please.
  - Don't make me laugh.
- - You think I'm the one that wants to destroy the world?
  - I'm the one that hates people?
- - That can't see the good in it?
  - Look around you.
- - Everywhere we turn, all we see is spite from our so-called fellow man.
  - Every day we turn on the news, we're constantly told by our leaders, our scientists, our religions that our world is crumbling, and that we are the problem.
- - We are the root of everything that is wrong, that we don't stand a chance.
  - We are told this so much that self-hatred is no longer considered an anomaly but a given, and yet you dare point the finger at me when I try to bring order to its chaos?
- - When I have sacrificed everything to make it better?
  - Please!
- - Don't make me laugh.
  - On the contrary, it is my love for people that drives me.
- - It always has been, because I know, deep in every person's heart They are trying to be good.
  - They were just dealt a bad hand by a world unfit for us so please don't make me fucking laugh and accuse me of hating people when you, Elliot, wear that hate like a badge of honor!
- - Shall I remind you of your group's name?
  - Admit it.
- - Hatred has been your anthem, not mine.
  - You're right.
- - I hate people.
  - I'm scared of them.
- - I've been scared of them practically my whole life.
  - People I loved people I trusted have done their absolute worst to me.
- - And for a long time, that's all I ever knew.
  - So, yeah, I called my group fsociety, because you know what?
- - fuck society.
  - Society deserves to be hated for everything you said they did and more.
- - fuck every last one of them for what we've all been through.
  - But then there are some people out there And it doesn't happen a lot.
- - It's rare.
  - But they refuse to let you hate them.
- - In fact, they care about you in spite of it.
  - And the really special ones, they're relentless at it.
- - Doesn't matter what you do to them.
  - They take it and care about you anyway.
- - They don't abandon you, no matter how many reasons you give them.
  - No matter how much you're practically begging them to leave.
- - And you wanna know why?
  - Because they feel something for me that I can't.
- - They love me.
  - And for all the pain I've been through, that heals me.
- - Maybe not instantly.
  - Maybe not even for a long time, but it heals.
- - And, yeah, there are setbacks.
  - We do fucked up things to each other.
- - And we hurt each other, and it gets messy, but that's just us, in any world you're in.
  - And, yeah, you're right.
- - We're all told we don't stand a chance, and yet we stand.
  - We break, but we keep going, and that is not a flaw.
- - That's what makes us.
  - So, no, I will not give up on this world.
- - And if you can't see why, then I speak for everyone when I say, fuck you!
  - Pity.
- - I thought we shared a vision.
  - What is that?
- - It appears the plant is losing power to the cooling system.
  - Why?
- - As you can imagine, my machine requires a significant amount of water, so it has to draw all the plant's power, including its backup generators.
  - You turned it on?
- - Of course I have.
  - We're on a very tight schedule.
- - Your machine.
  - It won't work.
- - I installed malware.
  - Yes, we discovered your breach.
- - How do you think we found you?
  - Then you know it already executed.
- - Except for the fact that my machine was already running by the time you installed your little exploit.
  - No, you don't understand.
- - Earlier you accused me of being a murderer, but soon you will see all those lives that have been lost so that we could get to this point will not be in vain.
  - In fact, they won't be lost at all.
- - They will all be found again as soon as this world around us transforms into a parallel world.
  - A world where we were meant to be all along.
- - The machine can't run here, and you know that.
  - It's going to cause a meltdown.
- - Which is why I have been trying to move my project.
  - Our tests here were quite limited in proximity, however you left me no choice.
- - Haven't you killed enough people?
  - Nobody will be killed.
- - The opposite, actually.
  - We will be reborn as new, finally liberated from the horrific and brutal past that we've been shackled to for so long.
- - You can't do this.
  - You said you loved people, but you're not giving them a choice.
- - You're not liberating them.
  - You're forcing this on them.
- - I am giving them a choice.
  - That's why you're here.
- - I'm going to show you what I showed Angela.
  - What do you mean?
- - All I ever wanted from you, Elliot, was your belief.
  - What are you gonna do with that?
- - I have learned to listen when time speaks.
  - Our paths were too precisely linked to this moment for there not to be a reason.
- - This is why.
  - You get to decide.
- - Then I'm telling you, don't do this!
  - I don't know what the fuck to do.
- - We need to figure out the code to this door.
  - Try that phone.
- - See if you can get an outside line.
  - Zero five zero nine.
- - Zero five zero nine.
  - Zero five zero nine.
- - Anything?
  - Zero five zero nine.
- - Zero five zero nine.
  - Zero five zero nine.
- - Let's go!
  - There's an access tunnel down the hall.
- - If we leave, the nuclear reactor's gonna melt down.
  - Which is why we need to get as far fucking away from here as possible.
- - If we don't stop this, the meltdown will destroy the whole town.
  - You wanna stop the meltdown?
- - How the fuck are we gonna do that?
  - She said she gave me a choice.
- - We don't have time for this shit.
  - I don't think this is just a game.
- - This place is gonna blow!
  - This is an override process to turn off the machine.
- - We've gotta get the fuck out of here!
  - It didn't work.
- - The alarms are still going.
  - We've gotta go!
- - No, I'm missing something.
  - She wanted us to win.
- - Did it work?
  - It's too late, isn't it?
- - I love you.
  - I love you, too.
- - It's an exciting time in the world.
  - This is your wakeup call.
- - This is your wakeup call.
  - This is your wakeup call.
- - This is your wakeup call.

  - It can't be, can it?
- - In New York City?
  - I don't know.
- - So weird.
  - Anyway, are you ready?
- - For what?
  - Presentation.
- - You said that you needed to stay up all night working on it.
  - Oh, yeah.
- - Sorry.
  - I don't know where my head is at.
- - Are you okay?
  - I woke up with a really bad headache.
- - I see you also haven't made any progress on packing.
  - I bought tape.
- - Okay, well, that's not nothing.
  - But it is almost nothing.
- - My dad just E-mailed me.
  - I have to head into work.
- - Don't tell me he's still checking the traffic for you.
  - You are such an only child.
- - You know me.
  - So I'll talk to you later, okay?
- - Elliot, you're not keeping anything from me, are you?
  - What would I be keeping from you?
- - I don't know.
  - You just seem different.
- - Must be this migraine I woke up with.
  - Now it's a migraine?
- - I'll check in with you later?
  - Love you.
- - I love you.
  - Hey.
- - Can't wait to marry you tomorrow.
  - Your call has been forwarded to an un
- - Mr. Robot, computer repair with a smile.
  - This is Edward.
- - Dad, where were you?
  - You're not answering your cell.
- - Ah, you know I always loose track of that thingamajig.
  - What's up, son?
- - I think Angela knows.
  - That's impossible.
- - No, I just talked to her.
  - She was acting suspicious.
- - I'm sure you're just being paranoid.
  - There's no way she could know.
- - Dad, I have a feeling, if she finds out, it will ruin everything.
  - Okay.
- - Calm down.
  - I'm sure you're just nervous about tomorrow.
- - Try to act normal.
  - There's no way she's gonna find out, okay?
- - You're right.
  - Okay.
- - Just finishing up a call.
  - Be out in a jiff.
- - I got a customer.
  - We still on for lunch?
- - Yeah.
  - Okay.
- - See you soon.
  - Hey, Dad?
- - Yeah?
  - Thanks.
- - No problem.
  - I'm always here for you.
- - Sorry for the wait.
  - How can I help you?
- - Oh.
  - There you are.
- - Residents of the Tri-State area were shaken up when a 5. 9 magnitude tremor struck Washington Township, New Jersey at about 7 -30 Yo.
  - Yo.
- - Do you have that deck ready?
  - E Corp guys will be here any minute.
- - What?
  - For the meeting.
- - You just said E Corp.
  - Don't you mean F Corp?
- - F Corp.
  - Yeah, that's what I meant.
- - You nervous?
  - You're never like this before presentation.
- - You're always stone cold.
  - Yeah, I don't know.
- - I'm not myself today, man.
  - What's up, my dudes?
- - Yeah, I heard we were taking a swing at F Corp today, B-Moc.
  - I'm sorry?
- - B-Moc.
  - The Big Man on Campus.
- - I don't think that's a thing.
  - It might be a stupid thing.
- - Anyway, here's what's up.
  - I'm awesome at talking to people.
- - For real, though.
  - Lunches, dinners, drinks.
- - I could sell ice to an Arab, sand to an Eskimo.
  - Yeah, you're not helping yourself out there.
- - Unless you're experimenting with some new form or racism.
  - I just want you to know I can be an asset for when not if but when you land this account.
- - What do you say?
  - You know what?
- - Don't take my word for it.
  - I I wanna take you out to lunch and prove to you what I'm all about.
- - But not today, though.
  - I'm meeting my new girl, Stella B.
- - Don't tell the girls in the office.
  - Cool, man.
- - Glad we did this.
  - Seriously.
- - Just pull up the debt and look over all the slides.
  - Let's build our future together When you have lunch with him, will you please tell him to never talk to me again?
- - Together we can change the world with F Corp.
  - Zhi Zhang, the world's richest person, continues to make news for her philanthropic endeavors.
- - Last month Miss Zhang donated $4.
  - 6 billion to her personal charity, the Whiterose Foundation, according to a filing published by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
- - Earth to Elliot.
  - You all right?
- - Just make sure all the flow charts are accurate.
  - We really need to land this account.
- - Okay.
  - With Allsafe at the wheel, F Corp can do what they do best navigate the world to a brighter future.
- - Any questions?
  - Can Elliot and I have the room, please?
- - I appreciate your presentation, but I don't think this place is right for us.
  - And why is that?
- - Let me ask you something, Elliot.
  - What's the worst thing about your life right now?
- - Well, the fact that you're passing on us already, I'd have to go with this meeting.
  - No, seriously.
- - Answer my question.
  - If I'm being honest The worst thing in my life Is also the best thing.
- - I get up every morning, I play my records, I get ready, get my coffee, I come to work, I'm stuck in a repetitive, boring routine that feels endless.
  - And, sure, I've imagined what it would be like to be someone with a more exciting life.
- - A risk-taker.
  - Someone more interesting.
- - But in the end, I know I'm lucky to be where I am.
  - Please have a seat.
- - I also feel the same about my life at F Corp.
  - It's the best and the worst thing that happened to me.
- - And the reason why I love my company so much is because of the value we provide, and people buy our products every day because they trust us.
  - F Corp is not only the best thing in my life.
- - It's the best thing in everyone's lives, but it could also be the cause of our undoing if I'm not careful.
  - So you see my dilemma here.
- - Tyrell, I pledge to you right now that if you go with Allsafe, the worst will never happen.
  - And how can you be so sure?
- - Because I've seen what can happen to your company, and I know how to prevent it.
  - You've seen what can happen to my company?
- - Yes.
  - If you look through our packets, we've created predictive models for every possible attack vector No, no, Elliot.
- - I just wanna know you're on my side.
  - Always.
- - Come on, son.
  - You just landed the biggest fish there is F Corp.
- - Celebrate!
  - Did you bring it?
- - A signed first-edition copy, just like you asked.
  - Shoot.
- - I need to make sure Angela isn't home when I drop it off.
  - I think her mom's there.
- - Hello?
  - Emily?
- - You there?
  - Weird.
- - She picked up and then she hung up on me.
  - I bet she's with Angela and doesn't want to spoil the surprise.
- - Come on.
  - Let's order.
- - I'm hungry.
  - Forgot my wallet.
- - Must have left it at home this morning.
  - That's not like you.
- - Must be nerves.
  - Okay.
- - Here you go.
  - You should buy her some flowers, too.
- - But first, we feast.
  - So you'll be gone for a while?
- - I already told you.
  - Why do you keep asking me?
- - No reason.
  - What are you up to?
- - Nothing.
  - You're up to something.
- - I can tell.
  - Trust me.
- - I trust you.
  - I just don't believe you.
- - Your parents in town yet?
  - Uh, yeah, they were just at my place.
- - I had to cancel lunch with them because of work.
  - Why?
- - Your dad sure loves to drink.
  - What's that?
- - Never mind.
  - Hey, I'm sorry I was acting weird this morning.
- - Just really excited about tomorrow.
  - What's tomorrow, again?
- - Mm.
  - What could it be?
- - Well, I have a new Pilates instructor I want you to try out.
  - I'm not a big Pilates guy.
- - Oh, we're trying that new sushi place in Chelsea finally?
  - Getting warmer.
- - We're finally getting married.
  - That couldn't be it, could it?
- - Cause I've got to lose myself tonight Is the radio okay?
  - Cause now the world's turned down a stop Could you actually turn it up?
- - Fading all the brights And the maybes and the mights And I should have known The hammer would drop Cause something must be wrong if everything is right And nothing's gonna stop us now Yeah nothing's gonna stop us now So turn up the radio And turn off the lights I want it loud as hell I want the walls to melt Cause I got to lose myself tonight Yeah I got to let it all go tonight Yeah I got to let it all go tonight
  - Who are you?
