  - Ugh!
- - The fuck did you just do?
  - Snap the fuck out of it!
- - This is not a person!
  - She is not real.
- - She is not your friend.
  - She is just a robot you use to buy paper towels.
- - Look around you.
  - Dom, this is emptiness.
- - There is nothing here for you, but there is still a chance for you out there if you come with us.
  - Now go get your toothbrush.
- - Why don't you go ahead without me?
  - I'll be there in a few minutes.

- - You're Dark Army.
  - No, dude.
- - I'm actually here to help my boy Elliot and his sis.
  - So what, you're just a a gun for hire, or I mean, it's like I always say Gotta keep a open mind at every opportunity that comes your way.
- - You've seen that one movie, Three Days of the Condor, right?
  - Dude, you've never seen Three Days of the Condor, and you're a fucking FBI agent?
- - You've gotta check that out.
  - Normally I don't go for that '70s paranoia shit, but I don't know, this one this one really spoke to me.
- - You know, maybe it was what my boy Joubert says I don't interest myself in the why.
  - I think more often in terms of the when, sometimes where, but always how much.
- - I fucking felt that.
  - Got me opening up my eyes to diversifying my revenue streams and whatnot.
- - Yo, last quarter, I nearly tripled my net profits, according to this chick who does my books, and shorty Japanese, so you know she know what the fuck she talking about.
  - She got me stumped off this one question, though, saying that I should incorporate sooner.
- - What do you think?
  - S Corp, or LLC?
- - Oh, shit.
  - I forgot to tell you he's working with us now.
- - You should get some rest.
  - So I've heard.
- - Midnight hour Almost over It's pretty out here.
  - I've never driven to Boston this way.
- - We're taking the scenic route.
  - One more chance couldn't be Yeah, believe it or not, Connecticut's swarming with Dark Army, given the concentration of RWAs.
- - Rich, white assholes.
  - Yep, that's who they like doing their business with.
- - Usually, that's their number one client, in fact.
  - Anyways, that's why we're staying off the main roads.
- - Besides, I gotta find a rest stop anyway.
  - Gotta steal me a mirror real quick.
- - I wonder what you'll do When your chance rolls around What, do you not know your Vonnegut?
  - You gotta know how much I want to keep you I gotta take a whiz, okay?
- - Too many Code Reds this morning.
  - I'm afraid it will all fall down Man, nobody fucking reads anymore.
- - Wait for me, all right I guess that's more than I should ask But won't you wait for me Please wait for me Although I know the light is fading fast What do you think of Jackie?
  - Jackie's whoever you want her to be.
- - Yeah, it's easy for you to say.
  - You're not pretending to be someone you're not.
- - You think Leon's my real name?
  - And ours is doing nothing But all the time we spent It must be good for something Please forgive all the disturbance I'm creating But you got a lot to learn if you think I'm not Where are we?
- - In the land of RWAs.
  - Wait for me, oh, I Best you keep your eye out.
- - Jackie's a diehard for Hall &amp; Oates.
  - She's a gym teacher.
- - No, she's not a gym teacher.
  - She's a pastry chef.
- - She's got a soft spot for Nutella.
  - We ready?
- - Not yet.
  - Leon said something about stealing a mirror and then went on about how illiterate America is and then said he had to piss a bunch of red, so I took that as my cue to walk away.
- - Look at all these people.
  - They're all probably on their way back home.
- - Holidays are over.
  - It's back to the grind for most of them, I guess.
- - It sucks.
  - I wanna show you something.
- - Come on.
  - Should we really be out in the open like this?
- - I don't know.
  - Maybe not, but
- - For once, I wanna drop the paranoia and just take all this in.
  - Just for this moment.
- - What is this moment, exactly?
  - Watch this.
- - What did you just do?
  - Just give it a few seconds.
- - Darlene, you're worrying me.
  - I'm pretty good at that, aren't I?
- - Tell me.
  - Be patient.
- - If you did something, I need to know.
  - Oh, do you?
- - Is this something illegal again?
  - Dom.
- - I'm serious, Darlene.
  - If you don't tell me what you're up to Just wait.
- - What is it with you and breaking the law?
  - It's like a fetish.
- - Shut the fuck up and just watch.
  - I don't get it.
- - What's going on?
  - All of the money Whiterose and her cronies have been stealing for decades just went back to the people.
- - How?
  - We found a way to evenly disperse it anonymously into everyone's Ecoin wallets.
- - Everyone got this much?
  - Yep.
- - And due to E Corp's insistence that Ecoin remain independent from the US dollar, it is completely impossible for them to reverse the transactions.
  - This is illegal.
- - This is stealing.
  - After what the Dark Army did to you?
- - fuck, after what they did to everyone, you really wanna start defending them?
  - This isn't what justice is supposed to look like.
- - We have laws for a reason.
  - And they were so powerful, they wrote the laws to benefit themselves.
- - They got away with everything because they banked on us, all of us, to trust the system.
  - That was our vulnerability, and they took advantage of it.
- - It took this to finally stop them, and you were a part of it.
  - Look around.
- - This is it.
  - Everything we've been through led up to this one moment The greatest redistribution of wealth in history.
- - We just Robin Hooded those evil M*therfuckers.
  - If you ask me, this is exactly what justice looks like.
- - Whoo!
  - Whoo!
- - Whoo!
  - People are staring at you.
- - I don't care!
  - fuck yeah, bitches!
- - May I have your attention, please.

  - For security reasons Hey, make sure you check out that Sydney Pollack joint when you get a chance.
- - Thank me later, Jackie.
  - So Did you keep any of it?
- - Keep what?
  - Covert.
- - That's cool.
  - I'm saying, though, if you're looking to get into some shit when you get back, I got some shit for you.
- - Like what?
  - Adventures and whatnot.
- - You know, a high like this it don't come so easy with the normies.
  - Thanks, dude, but, uh, I'm trying to lay low for a bit.
- - No doubt.
  - But with skills like yours, the pay is good, and you get to be your own boss, 'cause you know, you a boss, girl.

- - Please don't hurt us.
  - Hurt you?
- - Why would I hurt you?
  - Because I I disobeyed orders, I I killed my handler.
- - Oh, she was a pain in the ass.
  - Trust me, you were doing them a favor.
- - And and your little loudmouth friend over there, yeah, well, what she did was a bad thing, but Well, word around camp is they don't care about you two no more.
  - What do you mean?
- - They've picked up and skedaddled off to something more important.
  - Where?
- - That I can't tell you.
  - But all those things you said you were gonna do to my family.
- - No one cares about your family now.
  - Look, I'm telling you, the Dark Army's not something you need to worry about anymore.
- - Look, if they wanted to get to you two, I would know about it.
  - Trust me.
- - But But I I saw you butcher Santiago with an axe when he got out of line.
  - Yeah.
- - That was fun.
  - All right, well, this was nice.

- - She still needs to pay for that.
  - Take it easy, Dom.

  - And you did?
- - The cashier made me because he autographed it.
  - He actually said they don't care anymore.
- - Yep.
  - I don't get it.
- - Where did the Dark Army go?
  - I don't know, he wouldn't tell me.
- - All I know is we don't have to run anymore.
  - Yeah, but we're here.
- - Might as well still go.
  - I've heard Budapest is pretty dope.
- - Why Budapest anyway?
  - Cisco always talked about going there, but once what happened, happened I just couldn't go by myself.
- - How does the motion make me last Globe Airlines flight 4057 to Budapest will begin boarding at Gate B31.
  - That's us.

  - Why not?
- - He's running behind.
  - He's gonna catch the next flight out.
- - Let's go.
  - Wait.
- - I can't do this.
  - Can't do what?
- - You convinced me to come because the Dark Army was a threat.
  - Now they're not.
- - Doesn't mean we still can't go.
  - Do you even really want to go to Budapest anyway?
- - You said it yourself, this was Cisco's dream, not yours.
  - Then, we won't go there.
- - When we land, we'll hitch a ride to somewhere else.
  - Just come with me.
- - Darlene.
  - I can't go.
- - In these lines I know you're looking forward to them But you said you would.
  - What is it that has my mind You don't need me to come with you.

  - Running away to Budapest will help me?
- - This isn't about Budapest.
