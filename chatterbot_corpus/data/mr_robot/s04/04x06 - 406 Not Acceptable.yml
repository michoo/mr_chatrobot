  - I'm starting to pick up on that.
- - My mom got killed.
  - Murdered, actually.
- - Olivia's access isn't good enough.
  - You know why we came back here, right?

  - You're trying to destroy me.
- - I'm done talking to you.
  - One of your patients hacked me.
- - Krista.
  - I don't feel safe around you.
- - She knows something I gotta know.
  - It's time we talked.
- - I'm gonna tell you a story.
  - A story of a true Xmas miracle.
- - This is the tale of a bully and a little bitch.
  - I'm talking about a mean, nasty bully and a scrawny-ass little bitch.
- - This bully would pick on the little bitch every day after school.
  - If little bitch had cash, little bitch got robbed.
- - If little bitch bowed up, little bitch got stomped.
  - Point I'm trying to make here is, this bully owned that bitch like a Lincoln Continental, but something happened to change it all.
- - On this Xmas of our tale, little bitch got lucky with the gifts, see?
  - Something little bitch loved more than anything before family, God, and country was baseball.
- - Loved the shit out of it.
  - Well, on this Xmas morning when he got out of his little bedroom and looked under his little tree, guess what he found.
- - An Easton Magnum aluminum baseball bat.
  - Little bitch grabbed that bat and went right outside to play.
- - Didn't even take the bow off, he was so excited.
  - And there he was on the corner ball field, hitting balls like he was Sammy Sosa when his bully comes up, eyeing that bat.
- - And just as the bully made his way up to him, without any warning bam!
  - Blood.
- - fuckin' everywhere.
  - Blood on the ground, blood on little bitch, blood dripping down the bow still wrapped around that bat.
- - Little bitch knocked every tooth out of that m*therfucker's head.
  - Cracked his skull open, popped his eyeball out on home plate.
- - All because little bitch saw the truth.
  - That bat may have been made to play ball, but that wasn't its purpose.
- - Nuh-uh.
  - In that moment in little bitch's hands, it was there to break this nigga's head open.
- - See, Ms.
  - Krista, we all have a purpose in this world, and it's our lot in life to wait for the cosmos to reveal what that is.
- - But you don't have to look no more Cause for you, that day has come.
  - Want to know why?
- - I'm gonna break Elliot and you gonna be my aluminum bat.
  - I'm, uh I'm on my way to Olivia's now.
- - How are we gonna get to her boss?
  - We still need his login credentials to transfer the money.
- - Don't worry about it.
  - I have a plan.
- - Did the proxy hack at Virtual Realty check out?
  - Yeah, we're good.
- - I'm seeing all the unencrypted network traffic.
  - What about the venue for this Deus Group shindig?
- - Do we know where it's going down?
  - Uh, Price sent me the location.
- - It should be in your inbox.
  - There's a hotel across the street that we should work out of.
- - Are you there?
  - Darlene?
- - Yeah.
  - The other day, when I said that I should never have let you back in my life I was an asshole.
- - I'm sorry.
  - You still have my Signal mod running on your phone, right?
- - Yeah, why?
  - Just be careful, okay?
- - Keep your phone on you so I can see where you are.
  - I don't want to lose you again.
- - Oh, thank you.
  - I I got to go.
- - Elli.
  - Ah, long time no see, cuz.

  - So hang on to my number.
- - Should you need anything, you know I'm your guy.
  - You be strange, now, but don't be a stranger, know what I mean?
- - Peace, Elli.
  - We don't have to do this.
- - We can find a way to talk to her.
  - And if she says no?
- - Then we reason with her.
  - And if she still says no?
- - We don't have time for taking risks.
  - This is the only way.
- - Hey.
  - What you're about to do is crossing a line.
- - Well, it's a little late for that, don't you think?
  - He's right.
- - We used to have a code.
  - Lines we would not cross, parameters we set.
- - Those seem to have been seriously modified.
  - Question is, can we bring those boundaries back?
- - Or is it like he said, too late?
  - Two large peppermint mochas.
- - What were you doing in Pike's Hollow this morning?
  - How did you get in here?
- - Where's your brother?
  - Did you take him somewhere?
- - Is he still in the city?
  - Okay.
- - fuck, Darlene, you should have kept driving.
  - Who are you calling?
- - You can't call this in to the FBI.
  - If the Dark Army finds out about that crime scene, they're gonna send someone They already did.
- - Have a seat.
  - A guy who continually talks to an invisible entity that isn't there Has arguments with him.
- - The invisible entity interrupts him sometimes.

  - What's up?
- - It's about your clients.
  - My clients?
- - At Cyprus National Bank.
  - I never told you where I work.
- - A bank that primarily does business with the Deus Group.
  - Whoa.
- - What the fuck is this?
  - They're a criminal enterprise that uses their power and wealth to run the world without anyone knowing it.
- - Okay, I don't know why you're Tiananmen Square, civil war in the Congo, both Iraq wars, the paramilitary massacre in El Salado The cyber bombings.
  - That's not even their top five.
- - Okay You're really starting to scare me.

- - Why do you know where I work?
  - I hacked you.
- - Excuse me?
  - I hacked you.
- - Why?
  - I need you to do something for me.
- - What what is this?
  - I need you to make one phone call to your boss.
- - I'm already on their proxy server.
  - I just need him to log in so I can swipe his credentials.
- - I know this doesn't make sense to you right now, but trust me, Olivia they're using you.
  - They're using me?
- - They are, but I can stop them.
  - I can stop them once and for all.
- - All I need is one phone call from you.
  - Get out.
- - Don't do this.
  - Are you fucking kidding me?
- - This conversation's over.
  - Get the fuck out.
- - Now.
  - What happens if you fail a drug test?

  - You drugged me?
- - I had to make sure you would listen.
  - You're gonna call your boss in Cyprus.
- - You're gonna get him to log in to the bank website, and that's it.
  - Then I'm gone.
- - If you don't do what I say you lose your son.
  - Why are you doing this?
- - I was running out of time.
  - This was the fastest way to convince you.
- - This was taken one mile from where the van following Mr.
  - Alderson was found burned.
- - We have his sister, but we're still searching for him.
  - The minute we find him, I think You think what?
- - It's time, Minister Zhang.
  - He's too much of a liability.
- - Oh, you're being foolish.
  - If we kill him, his shipping hack dies with him.
- - We have the Deus Group meeting tonight.
  - Think about what you're saying.
- - The entire membership will be there.
  - It's too risky.
- - I will not get this close only to watch it slip away again.
  - I want you to locate Mr.
- - Alderson and bring him in.
  - He should see the full potential of what we're working towards.
- - It's time he learns we're on the same side.
  - Placemat.
- - Bandit.
  - How's everything over there?
- - Fine.
  - Good news and bad news.
- - The higher-ups want Elliot, not his sister.
  - I don't suppose she's mentioned where he is yet?
- - She wouldn't do that.
  - I heard her talking to him earlier, though.
- - We can get his location off her phone.
  - Oh, interesting.
- - And you have her phone, I assume.
  - Yeah, I got it right here, so we don't need her.
- - Fantastic.
  - Well, then, I'll be there with my team to collect the phone.
- - And her?
  - Kill her.
- - What?
  - You said it yourself.
- - We don't need her.
  - Cleaner this way.
- - You can handle that, right?
  - Mm-hmm.
- - Because I recall the last time you didn't feel 100 No.
  - I'm fine.
- - I'm just saying, if you don't feel 100% like last time, you should let me know right now so I can set aside the time to kill your mother and your entire family.
  - No.
- - I can handle it.
  - Great.
- - I'll be there at 3 -30 on the dot.
  - Make sure it's done by then.
- - What?
  - What did they say?
- - fuck!
  - What the fuck?
- - Wait!
  - Wait!
- - fucking wait!
  - Get up!
- - What the fuck are you doing?
  - Keeping my family safe.
- - On your knees!
  - So this is it, then?
- - They tell you to kill me, and you're just gonna do it?
  - Your phone gives them Elliot's location, so they don't need you.
- - This is crazy.
  - This isn't you, Dom!
- - You don't need to fucking do this!
  - I can't believe you have the balls to say that.
- - You ruined my life.
  - I did.
- - I'll own that, okay?
  - But that doesn't make you this!
- - You don't just fucking shoot people in cold blood!
  - I'm here because of you.
- - I know.
  - You did this to me!
- - I know!
  - Okay, you were right.
- - Okay?
  - I was wrong.
- - Give me a chance to make it right.
  - I can get you out of this.
- - There's no way out.
  - I have a plan.
- - You think I give a shit about your plan?
  - We are gonna take down the Dark Army once and for all.
- - It's happening tonight.
  - It's too late.
- - Please, Dom, it's not too late.
  - No, it has to be like this.
- - There's not enough time.
  - It's too late.
- - Dom, listen to me!
  - They coming at 3 -30.
- - Listen to me.
  - I know I fucked up, okay?
- - But it's not too late.
  - If you let me go, I can stop this, okay?
- - I swear to God, if you just let me go.
  - Please!
- - I'm sorry.
  - No, no, no, please!
- - Don't be sorry, Dom.
  - Don't be, don't be!
- - Don't be sorry, Dom, okay?
  - Please, Dom, don't be sorry.
- - You don't need to do this.
  - You are a good person!
- - This isn't you!
  - Shut up!
- - shit, shit, shit.
  - shit.
- - How soon can he get back to me?
  - It's urgent, yes.
- - I know, but it's regarding Mr.
  - Kuklachev.
- - He'll want to know.
  - Okay, great.
- - Merry Christmas.
  - How long do you think it'll be?
- - fuck you.
  - My life is over.
- - I want you to know that.
  - You just have to talk to him.
- - Then I'll go.
  - Nothing will be traced to you.
- - And you think that's it, huh?
  - You just drugged an addict.
- - You'll get through it.
  - You arrogant piece of shit.
- - Maybe you can have a slip and it's not the end of the world, but I can't.
  - It destroys me.
- - So fuck you.
  - Maybe you should have thought about that before you worked for them.
- - What's that supposed to mean?
  - Offshore bank in Cyprus.
- - Kind of money that goes through there.
  - You know, come on.
- - You're not dumb.
  - I'm sure a part of you has always known.
- - You chose to look the other way.
  - My choices are none of your business.
- - I get it.
  - You needed a job.
- - They were paying well.
  - That's how they do it.
- - That's their business model.
  - They back everyone into a corner until all that's left is for us to compromise ourselves.
- - That's why what I'm doing has to be done.
  - They're hurting you just like they're hurting all of us.
- - The only one hurting me right now is you.
  - I wonder how many people you've had to hurt to get what you want.
- - Hmm?
  - How many has it been, Elliot?
- - How many people have had to suffer because of you?
  - Was it worth it?
- - I'm a mess.
  - Can I use the bathroom?
- - Yeah, go ahead.
  - So was fucking me part of the plan, or was that just a happy accident?
- - It was an accident.
  - That's sweet.
- - It's almost done.
  - Once her boss calls back, we'll get what we need and go.
- - This would have all been simpler if she wasn't so deep in denial about who she's working for.
  - There it is.
- - That sense of dread.
  - It only happens when you cross a line you didn't even know existed.
- - Maybe that dread is a good thing.
  - After all, when you realize you've crossed a line That means you still had one.
- - When those crossed lines are all behind you, up ahead is only darkness.
  - He has insomnia, social anxiety.
- - I I don't know what else to tell you.
  - Morphine addiction, jail time, dead daddy.
- - You're giving me the knockoffs, girl.
  - I want the brand name.
- - Please let me go.
  - Whatever you're looking for, I don't have it.
- - I know the two of you had a special relationship.
  - Special?
- - He hacked me.
  - He threatened my last boyfriend.
- - He threatened me.
  - You know, I had to stop seeing him because he scared me so much.
- - You weren't scared of him!
  - You loved his ass!
- - I saw the look on your face.
  - Don't lie to me.
- - This isn't going to work.
  - Your outbursts.
- - Just because you were bullied as a kid, because people hurt you until that day you swung a bat and learned how to hurt them back doesn't mean it's going to work with me.
  - W-wait a minute.
- - Wait a fucking second.
  - Miss Krista, are you are you calling me a little bitch?
- - Yo, Peanuts.
  - You hear that, what she called me?
- - She called you a little bitch.
  - Hey, Javi.
- - You hear her calling me a little bitch?
  - That's what I heard.
- - See?
  - That's why you're good.
- - Not even my bitch can call me a little bitch.
  - Oh, my God!
- - Who's that?
  - Jason.
- - Jason, huh?
  - That your boy?
- - Maybe we should bring him in here.
  - Maybe that's what'll what'll get you going.
- - Hello, babe.
  - Are you in there?
- - How about that, Miss Krista?
  - We gon' have one big merry-merry.
- - I was able to stop the bleeding.
  - Gonna be okay.
- - I'm sorry.
  - I don't believe you.
- - You said the people I work for They were behind the massacre in El Salado?
  - My mom died there.
- - I know.
  - Olivia I can stop them.
- - Hi.
  - Um, I'm sorry to bother you on a holiday, but Mr.
- - Kuklachev needs the authorization to transfer funds.
  - You don't see the request?
- - Are you sure?
  - I still don't see it.
- - Okay, that's strange.
  - He said it was urgent.
- - Maybe he changed his mind.
  - I'll just I'll just check back with him and and get back to you.
- - Okay, thanks.
  - Merry Christmas to you too.
- - I'll wipe all the traces of you and your boss's involvement.
  - Nothing will be linked back to you.
- - You know, I may work for monsters But you are one.
  - And you're the worst kind, because you don't even know it.
- - Oh, damn.
  - Your boy's upset you didn't let him in.
- - Ah, all right.
  - Now before your boy came and went, you were calling me a little bitch?
- - Chill, girl.
  - I didn't take no offense.
- - In fact, this was my bad, 'cause I didn't tell you the whole story.
  - See, I was just explaining your role to you.
- - That you my bat.
  - But that bat ain't the end of the story.
- - Nah.
  - That's where I come in.
- - So after being beaten within an inch of his life by that badass little bitch, the bully woke up in the hospital.
  - It was right then when little bitch walked in like the fucking ghost of Xmas past.
- - Bully sees him and starts crying.
  - I mean, this nigga was scared.
- - He must have thought that boy had come to finish him off.
  - But you know what happened?
- - Little bitch just walked right up to his bully's bed And held his hand.
  - Yep.
- - He held his hand Just like so.
  - Real soft and gentle-like.
- - And then he got real close.
  - He looks at his bully, all sniffling and crying.
- - He looked at him and said I see you now.
  - Little bitch showed up when no one else would.
- - He saw his bully like no one else could and that was all it took.
  - And, Miss Krista, from that moment on, he owned that bully for life.
- - Now, if I want to own Elliot, I don't just gotta break him.
  - Me and Elliot are linked on a spiritual plane.
- - I got to come at him on the same level I find myself, and and breaking him only gets you so far.
  - I gotta break him so I can build him up.
- - I need to wound his soul so I can be the one to heal him.
  - That is how you own a nigga.
- - Now, the next words out of your mouth have to be exactly what I want.
  - Not for my sake, but for yours and for your boy Jason, who lives up on 1404 Jay Street.
- - Now, you know what I want.
  - You got to give it to me.
- - You do that, I got no reason not to turn you loose.
  - Look me in my eye.
- - Trust me.
  - Go to the filing cabinet in my office.
- - There's a folder in the bottom drawer.
  - Go to the tab that says September 2015.
- - Look for Elliot's name.
  - What am I gonna find there?
- - Mr.
  - Robot.
- - What's that?
  - That is how you'll break him.
- - Oh, my head hurts.
  - I thought you were gonna kill me.
- - They gave me an hour.
  - How long has it been?
- - Just unlock your phone.
  - All they want is Elliot's location.
- - I can't.
  - You can.
- - What would you do if it was your family?
  - I'm doing it.
- - You know that night we spent together?
  - I know you probably think of it as the worst night of your life The night all this shit went to shit.
- - But when I think about it, it was Don't.
  - Nice.
- - The last time I remember actually feeling good.
  - You were just using me.
- - You know it was more than that.
  - Look whatever you have to do, I get it.
- - Okay?
  - But just just at least believe that.
- - I'm out of time.
  - Get up.
- - Where are we going?
  - Come on, get up.
- - Where are we going?
  - Up.
- - Come on, let's go.
  - You got the jump on me, and before I knew what was happening, it was over.
- - What are you talking about?
  - Take it and make it quick.
- - You want me to shoot you?
  - It's the only way.
- - Come on, we're running out of time.
  - You have to kill me.
- - I'm not fucking killing you, okay?
  - Let's go.
- - We can make a run for it.
  - If they show up and we're gone, my family's dead.
- - Don't you get it?
  - My life puts everyone I love in danger.
- - This won't stop until I'm dead.
  - I'm not gonna fucking kill you.
- - I'd do it myself if I could.
  - I've thought about it every day for the past two months, but I can't do it.
- - I can't do it.
  - Please, Darlene, just pull the fucking trigger.
- - I can't.
  - Just pull the fucking trigger!
- - Dom, please.
  - Pull the fucking trigger!
- - I can't.
  - Do it!
- - Dominique?
  - Well, now, I was not expecting this.
- - I I'm stunned.
  - I I don't know what to say.
- - My goodness.
  - Oh.
- - Oh, don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you.
  - You are still far too useful to us for that.
- - But this is going to be so painful for you.
  - Now, where's the phone?
- - I want you to understand, I mean you no ill will.
  - My instructions were to find your brother.
- - Well, in that case, my phone's not gonna do you any good.
  - I just wiped it.
- - Huh.
  - Shouldn't we be talking about what just happened?
- - We got the access we needed to transfer the money from the bank's side.
  - Once we hack all of the members' phones tonight at their meeting, we can rob them blind.
- - That's not what I meant.
  - What you meant doesn't matter.
- - Krista?
  - Elliot, I need to see you.
- - I'm actually kind of busy.
  - Can I call you tomorrow?
- - I was kidnapped by someone you know.
  - Fernando Vera.
- - He wanted to know everything about you, everything I knew.
  - I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do.
- - I didn't have a choice.
  - He had a gun.
- - Once he got what he wanted, he let me go.
  - I went to the police, but now I'm too afraid to go back home.
- - I'm scared.
  - Wait, wait, slow down.
- - Where are you right now?
  - I'm-I don't know.
- - Downtown, I think.
  - I can meet you at Washington Square Park.
- - Can you get there?
  - I think so.
- - I'll see you soon.
  - Okay.
- - There's no way he's just gonna let her go.
  - I know.
- - Here we go again, off to play the hero.
  - But is that even who we are anymore?
- - You saw what we did back there.
  - We just watched him destroy someone's life and none of us did a thing about it.
- - Rules, morals, parameters they only break if you're broken to begin with.
  - Did we change under pressure, or did this only reveal who we really are?
- - I don't know anymore.
  - The one thing I do know is Hey, hey!
- - Wait, wait, wait!
  - Help!
- - Hey!
  - Hey, hey!
- - Help!
  - Help!
