  - shit.
- - Hey, dude, you're straight up trying to steal my car.
  - It's cool, man.

  - You don't need to call the cops, okay?
- - I'm walking away.
  - No hold on.
- - You trying to steal my car and walk away.
  - What's up?
- - Dude, do you really want to deal with the hassle of calling the cops?
  - It's just gonna end in an all-nighter for you at the station, followed by a shit ton of paperwork.
- - Besides, nothing nothing happened.
  - You busted me, I'm walking away.
- - No harm, no foul.
  - Yeah, but I got questions that need answering.
- - First, have you seen my keys?
  - No.
- - That was my only question.
  - Can I please go now?
- - Oh, wait, I got another question.
  - Can you start my car?
- - Really?
  - Yeah, I usually use my keys, and I can't seem to find them.
- - Okay, you're not really planning on driving like this, are you?
  - Well, I gotta get home.
- - Dude, you are drunk as shit.
  - Can't you just call a cab or something?
- - No, cabs don't go where I'm headed.
  - Where is that, the North Pole?
- - No.
  - It's Upstate.
- - Foxrock.
  - What's your name?
- - Tobias.
  - Hi, Tobias.
- - I'm Darlene.
  - We're friends, right?
- - Yeah, I'd like that.
  - Great.
- - So here's an idea.
  - I'll drive you home if I can borrow your car afterwards for a quick errand.
- - You drive a hard bargain, Dolly.
  - Darlene.
- - Exactly.
  - Let's ride!
- - Oh, guys, I understand, but like I said, Internet's down.
  - Phone's hooked to the Internet, so that means phone is down too.
- - We're kind of in the middle of nowhere here.
  - None of our phones have service.
- - There's gotta be someplace nearby with cell reception.
  - Sure, back in town.
- - What town?
  - Pike's Hollow.
- - How do we get there?
  - It's too far to walk unless you take the shortcut.
- - But my husband's coming to pick me up in a bit, if you want a ride.
  - Where's the shortcut?
- - Got it!
  - Tyrell Wellick, right?
- - That's how I know you.
  - But I never knew you were on Big Brother.
- - Holy smokes!
  - I cannot believe you are in my store.
- - Can I get a selfie?
  - No, I'm not him.
- - You have me confused, okay?
  - The shortcut, how do we get there?
- - Are you sure you're not Tyrell Wellick?
  - E Corp fella.
- - You are the spitting image of him.
  - Yes, I'm sure.
- - That's too bad.
  - Sure like to meet him one day.
- - Seems like a nice guy.
  - Jesus fucking Christ, woman!
- - Where is the shortcut?
  - How the fuck do we get to town?
- - Whoa, aren't you friggin' rude?
  - Directly across the street, you'll see an opening to a trail, and that will take you through the woods for a stretch, but be sure you veer left at the creek.
- - You'll find yourself in Pike's Hollow in 30 minutes or so.
  - fucking finally.
- - Wouldn't hurt you to learn some manners on the walk.
  - This is the right trail, right?
- - The one across from the gas station.
  - There was only one.
- - Are you sure?
  - Yeah.
- - So quiet out here.
  - Have you ever considered leaving?
- - What do you mean?
  - Just walking off, disappearing, leaving the life you're living behind you, all the bullshit, the stress, the pain, everything?
- - You know, maybe start over where no one knows you and reinvent yourself and forget about all the mistakes you made in this life.
  - Find some peace.
- - Some rest.
  - I think about that.
- - Don't you?
  - No.
- - Any sign of the creek?
  - Well, maybe it's still up ahead.
- - Ah.
  - We've been walking for a while.
- - We shoulda come across it by now.
  - How do you know if we should have come across it by now?
- - Because we've been walking for fucking hours.
  - That's how.
- - Don't get mad at me.
  - I don't know where the goddamn creek is.
- - You were the one who took off this way.
  - Unbelievable you're blaming me that we're lost?
- - I blame you that we're even here.
  - You said he was dead.
- - He was.
  - Well, then how did he drive the van?
- - I don't fucking know!
  - All right, all right.
- - Let's all calm down.
  - Take it easy.
- - What was that?
  - A dog?
- - Who knows?
  - We're in the middle of the woods.
- - Could be anything.
  - Maybe a coyote.
- - Or a wolf.
  - That.
- - You hear it?
  - Let's just keep going.
- - Maybe the creek is up ahead.
  - She knew my face.
- - What?
  - The cashier.
- - She knew my face.
  - So what?
- - That means she can ID me.
  - You search, you find, all is well.
- - But what if you search and you don't find?
  - How long do you look?
- - Eventually, you've gotta give up, right?
  - Then what?
- - That thing you were searching for, what becomes of it?
  - How could you ever know?
- - Joey Baby
  - Don't get crazy Big night tonight?
- - Uh, no.
  - I'm not the real Santa.
- - Yeah.
  - Sometimes I wish I were.
- - Sometimes I wish I were I know you've heard it all before So I don't say it anymore Where'd you go there, Tobias?
  - Oh, just thinking.
- - Jimmy.
  - Good guy.
- - Fell on some tough times.
  - You know how sometimes the world just seems like it's kicking you down and you can't get up?
- - Christ, do I ever.
  - That's Jimmy.
- - And you know how it is.
  - Soon you're out in the cold winter night, asking a lot of questions, looking at the world, thinking about what it might be like without you in it.
- - Do you have to do that?
  - It's a Christmas song.
- - It's annoying.
  - I just got it.
- - Why you wear that hoodie.
  - I've never seen you in anything else.
- - Black hoodie, black jeans, black shoes, always the same.
  - I've been wondering this whole time, but now I finally get it.
- - You don't care.
  - Sure, why not?
- - Silk tie, $6,000 suit.
  - I mean, it sounds pathetic to say aloud, but I actually care.
- - And you know what?
  - That's why I'm a failure.
- - My entire life, I've been an outsider, worried what other people think of me, how I can make them happy, because I needed their approval and their acceptance.
  - But you never cared.
- - The first day we met, there we were, Allsafe's most important clients roaming through the office, and you couldn't care less.
  - We're gonna die out here.
- - Maybe not tonight, but soon.
  - The Dark Army soldier, he's likely reported back by now.
- - It's only a matter of time before they find us.
  - Did you hear that?
- - If there's traffic, we gotta be close to town.
  - Hey!
- - Hey!
  - Hey!
- - Hey!
  - Hey!
- - Hey!
  - Jesus Christ!

  - Salvation Army?
- - Sloan Kettering.
  - It's a cancer center.
- - I do it for the kids.
  - Dude, that's dope.
- - You're definitely a better person than me.
  - So what, the kids served spiked nog?
- - No, me and some of the other volunteers, we got a little tradition after visiting the hospital.
  - What's that?
- - We get drunk.
  - Nice tradition, I guess.
- - Yeah, you know the kids, they love when we drop by.
  - So many smiling faces.
- - This might be the last time I do it though.
  - You know, the thing that really gets you?
- - Some of 'em are so small.
  - It's almost as if they were just born to die.
- - Jesus.
  - No wonder you're plastered.
- - How else do you get through that?
  - Well, it was easier when my wife went with me, but since the accident What do you got there, Tobias?
- - Oh, I like to keep a nip or two on me during the holidays.
  - I'm not talking about the booze.
- - Oh, Percocet.
  - Sometimes the the pain's just too much.
- - Alexa, play slow jams playlist.
  - Playing slow jams playlist.

- - Hold on now.
  - Whose car is that?
- - That was gonna be my question.
  - Hey.
- - That's my car.
  - Oh, I get it now.
- - Uh, you see, I didn't drive today.
  - Kenny drove.
- - He picked me up at Okay, Tobias.

  - Good-bye is short and final.
- - Hey.
  - Hey.
- - Hey.
  - Look, I know it might not be my place, but I wanna help you.
- - You wanna help me?
  - I don't want you to hurt yourself.
- - Holy crow, what the heck are you talking about?

- - Jimmy Stewart.
  - It's a Wonderful Life.
- - Christmas classic.
  - Tobias, you just told me good-bye is final.
- - That is Steinbeck.
  - He's a national treasure.
- - Read a book.
  - Okay, what about the pills?
- - Okay, you're drunk as shit and you have a bottle of Percocet.
  - Explain that.
- - For my wife.
  - Your wife's dead.
- - My wife is dead?
  - Wait you said she had an accident.
- - She threw her back out when we were putting the Santa on the roof yesterday.
  - She's in brutal pain.
- - She can barely move.
  - Doc wrote a prescription Okay, you fucking scared me.
- - Hey, Dolly.
  - Darlene.
- - Are you okay?
  - Yeah, I'm okay.
- - Why wouldn't I be?
  - You wanna talk about it?
- - There's nothing to talk about.
  - You sure?
- - Yes.
  - All right.
- - Have a great night.
  - Fine.
- - I have lost absolutely everyone, my boyfriend, my best friend, my parents.
  - The only one I have left is my brother, who is an asshole that treats me like absolute shit.
- - But I'm really worried about him right now, and it pisses me off that I'm worried, because I am always worried about him, and he flat-out told me to fuck off.
  - So why do I bother?
- - I don't know.
  - I don't know, I'm afraid this time it's different.
- - I'm afraid he might be dead.
  - Okay.
- - Reception?
  - No.
- - Time.
  - Just realizing it's Christmas.
- - Can't be much further.
  - To what?
- - Town.
  - Let's stop lying to ourselves.
- - We're nowhere near town.
  - We're completely lost.
- - We just gotta keep moving.
  - Why?
- - Even if we magically made it to this Pike's Hollow place, the town is gonna be swarming with Dark Army.
  - We've gotta try.
- - You aren't listening to me.
  - Whatever we're walking towards, it ends with death.
- - What are you doing?
  - There's a rock in my shoe.
- - You honestly don't care about me, do you?
  - What are you talking about now?
- - Like why you wear that same hoodie every day.
  - You don't care.
- - Did you ever care about me?
  - I mean, be honest, I can take it.
- - What is the point of this?
  - Just answer the question, did you?
- - Tyrell, you didn't make it easy Just answer the question!
  - No!
- - The sound of death.
  - It's just some stupid animal.
- - Let's go.
  - Go without me.
- - What?
  - You're giving up?
- - Yeah.
  - I think so.
- - I can't deal with this shit anymore.
  - Come on.
- - You stay out here alone, you can be sure it's game over.
  - You're better than this.
- - Yeah, maybe I was, but not anymore.
  - I'm going.
- - Yeah, go, Elliot.
  - I will.
- - Yeah, good.
  - Cause you don't need me.
- - You never needed me.
  - That's the truth, right?
- - Yeah, that's the truth, I never fucking needed you!
  - You were only in the way!
- - If it weren't for you The world would've been saved?
  - And you would have been the savior?
- - Is that what you think?
  - Is that the fantasy I ruined for you?
- - Stay here, die!
  - I don't give a fuck about you!
- - I'm done!
  - Good!
- - Look around you!
  - All signs lead to the same hopeless destination, and the sooner you realize that, the better, for you're so much in your own head that you can't see the truth!
- - That it's over!
  - Seems like we're always thinking of ourselves when looking for something that's lost, but we never think much about the lost, whatever, whoever is unable to be found, whether it's a set of keys left somewhere and forgotten, a couple of guys wandering aimlessly in the woods, or someone who's disappeared inside himself.
- - What if that's what they wanted all along?
  - Not to be found.
- - You're wrong.
  - I don't like being an outsider either.
- - Maybe I'm just good at hiding it.
  - Why'd you come back?
- - Why aren't you going?
  - I don't know.
- - I guess it felt wrong to leave you.
  - Besides, I think you're the only person I know that actually likes me.
- - You were right about one thing.
  - I've known that we're gonna die since we walked out of that gas station and the van was gone.
- - I don't think there's a way out of this for us.
  - Why do you want to keep going?
- - My sister.
  - I have to warn her.
- - I have to at least try.
  - I got her into this miss.
- - Same as last time and the time before that.
  - I've been a horrible brother.
- - I treated her like shit.
  - Least I can do is call her and tell her to run.
- - Maybe she can still escape.
  - How much longer do you think until they find us?
- - I don't know, man.
  - All right.
- - Let's keep moving.
  - Maybe you can still make that phone call.
- - Dolly.
  - Dar what?
- - I know you're worried about your brother, but you gotta worry about you too.
  - I'm trying.
- - And I hope he's not dead.
  - Merry Christmas.
- - Hi.
  - Ho, ho, ho.
- - Santa's home.
  - Fu
- - Tyrell.
  - You okay?
- - Oh, Jesus Christ.
  - I'm okay.
- - We can't just leave him here.
  - Gotta get you to a hospital, man.
- - fuck.
  - No no hospital.
- - The Dark Army will find me; they'll find you.
  - No no, we gotta keep moving, man.
- - We'll find someplace that can help you.
  - No, I'm done.
- - Burn the van and all the evidence.
  - Make sure you take care of Whiterose.
- - Okay?
  - Tyrell.
- - I can't let you die.
  - I'm just gonna go for a walk.
